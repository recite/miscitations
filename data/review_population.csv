OBJECTIVE To systematically review evidence on benefits and harms of behavioral and pharmacotherapy weight loss and weight loss maintenance interventions in adults to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, PubMed Publisher-Supplied Records, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies published through June 6, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials through August 2017; and ongoing surveillance in targeted publications through March 23, 2018. Studies from previous reviews were reevaluated for inclusion. STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) focusing on weight loss or weight loss maintenance in adults. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were abstracted by one reviewer and confirmed by another. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for weight loss outcomes in behavior-based interventions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Health outcomes, weight loss or weight loss maintenance, reduction in obesity-related conditions, and adverse events. RESULTS A total of 122 RCTs (N = 62 533) and 2 observational studies (N = 209 993) were identified. Compared with controls, participants in behavior-based interventions had greater mean weight loss at 12 to 18 months (-2.39 kg [95% CI, -2.86 to -1.93]; 67 studies [n = 22065]) and less weight regain (-1.59 kg [95% CI, -2.38 to -0.79]; 8 studies [n = 1408]). Studies of medication-based weight loss and maintenance interventions also reported greater weight loss or less weight regain in intervention compared with placebo groups at 12 to 18 months (range, -0.6 to -5.8 kg; nometa-analysis). Participants with prediabetes in weight loss interventions had a lower risk of developing diabetes compared with controls (relative risk, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.51 to 0.89]). There was no evidence of other benefits, but most health outcomes such as mortality, cardiovascular disease, and cancer were infrequently reported. Small improvements in quality of life in some medication trials were noted but were of unclear clinical significance. There was no evidence of harm such as cardiovascular disease from behavior-based interventions; higher rates of adverse events were associated with higher dropout rates in medication groups than in placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Behavior-based weight loss interventions with or without weight loss medications were associated with more weight loss and a lower risk of developing diabetes than control conditions. Weight loss medications, but not behavior-based interventions, were associated with higher rates of harms. Long-term weight and health outcomes data, as well as data on important subgroups, were limited.","[LeBlanc, Erin S.; Patnode, Carrie D.; Webber, Elizabeth M.; Redmond, Nadia; Rushkin, Megan; O'Connor, Elizabeth A.] Kaiser Permanente, Ctr Hlth Res, Res Affiliates Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Portland, OR USA",,"LeBlanc, ES (corresponding author), Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Ctr Hlth Res, Res Affiliates Evidence Based Practice Ctr, 3800 N Interstate Ave, Portland, OR 97227 USA.",Erin.S.LeBlanc@kpchr.org,,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA290201200015I, 6]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA290201200015I, Task Order 6, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the USPSTF.",,214,156,161,3,25,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

ObservationsDementia is an acquired loss of cognition in multiple cognitive domains sufficiently severe to affect social or occupational function. In the United States, Alzheimer disease, one cause of dementia, affects 5.8 million people. Dementia is commonly associated with more than 1 neuropathology, usually Alzheimer disease with cerebrovascular pathology. Diagnosing dementia requires a history evaluating for cognitive decline and impairment in daily activities, with corroboration from a close friend or family member, in addition to a thorough mental status examination by a clinician to delineate impairments in memory, language, attention, visuospatial cognition such as spatial orientation, executive function, and mood. Brief cognitive impairment screening questionnaires can assist in initiating and organizing the cognitive assessment. However, if the assessment is inconclusive (eg, symptoms present, but normal examination findings), neuropsychological testing can help determine whether dementia is present. Physical examination may help identify the etiology of dementia. For example, focal neurologic abnormalities suggest stroke. Brain neuroimaging may demonstrate structural changes including, but not limited to, focal atrophy, infarcts, and tumor, that may not be identified on physical examination. Additional evaluation with cerebrospinal fluid assays or genetic testing may be considered in atypical dementia cases, such as age of onset younger than 65 years, rapid symptom onset, and/or impairment in multiple cognitive domains but not episodic memory. For treatment, patients may benefit from nonpharmacologic approaches, including cognitively engaging activities such as reading, physical exercise such as walking, and socialization such as family gatherings. Pharmacologic approaches can provide modest symptomatic relief. For Alzheimer disease, this includes an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor such as donepezil for mild to severe dementia, and memantine (used alone or as an add-on therapy) for moderate to severe dementia. Rivastigmine can be used to treat symptomatic Parkinson disease dementia. Conclusions and RelevanceAlzheimer disease currently affects 5.8 million persons in the United States and is a common cause of dementia, which is usually accompanied by other neuropathology, often cerebrovascular disease such as brain infarcts. Causes of dementia can be diagnosed by medical history, cognitive and physical examination, laboratory testing, and brain imaging. Management should include both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches, although efficacy of available treatments remains limited. This narrative review summarizes published evidence on the diagnosis and management of dementia, including criteria distinguishing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from dementia, newer approaches to diagnostic testing and imaging, and nonpharmacologic and drug treatment approaches.","[Arvanitakis, Zoe; Shah, Raj C.; Bennett, David A.] Rush Univ, Med Ctr, Rush Alzheimers Dis Ctr, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Arvanitakis, Zoe; Bennett, David A.] Rush Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurol Sci, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Shah, Raj C.] Rush Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Family Med, Chicago, IL 60612 USA",,"Arvanitakis, Z (corresponding author), 1750 W Harrison St,Ste 1000, Chicago, IL 60612 USA.",zarvanit@rush.edu,"Shah, Raj/AAS-2210-2021","Shah, Raj/0000-0001-9706-9730","National Institutes of Health [P30 AG010161, R01 AG040039, R01 NS084965, RF1 AG059621]; Health Resources and Services Administration [HRSA-15-057]; Illinois Department of Public Health; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE [R01NS084965] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING [P30AG010161, RF1AG059621] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Health Resources and Services Administration(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Health Resources & Service Administration (HRSA)); Illinois Department of Public Health; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),"This study was supported by the National Institutes of Health (P30 AG010161, R01 AG040039, R01 NS084965, and RF1 AG059621); the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA-15-057); and the Illinois Department of Public Health.",,114,241,253,29,151,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

OBJECTIVE To develop a set of evidence-based recommendations for patient blood management (PBM) and for research. EVIDENCE REVIEW The scientific committee developed 17 Population/Intervention/ Comparison/Outcome (PICO) questions for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in adult patients in 3 areas: preoperative anemia (3 questions), RBC transfusion thresholds (11 questions), and implementation of PBM programs (3 questions). These questions guided the literature search in 4 biomedical databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Transfusion Evidence Library), searched from inception to January 2018. Meta-analyses were conducted with the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology and the Evidence-to-Decision framework by 3 panels including clinical and scientific experts, nurses, patient representatives, and methodologists, to develop clinical recommendations during a consensus conference in Frankfurt/Main, Germany, in April 2018. FINDINGS From 17 607 literature citations associated with the 17 PICO questions, 145 studies, including 63 randomized clinical trials with 23 143 patients and 82 observational studies with more than 4 million patients, were analyzed. For preoperative anemia, 4 clinical and 3 research recommendations were developed, including the strong recommendation to detect and manage anemia sufficiently early before major elective surgery. For RBC transfusion thresholds, 4 clinical and 6 research recommendations were developed, including 2 strong clinical recommendations for critically ill but clinically stable intensive care patients with or without septic shock (recommended threshold for RBC transfusion, hemoglobin concentration <7 g/dL) as well as for patients undergoing cardiac surgery (recommended threshold for RBC transfusion, hemoglobin concentration <7.5 g/dL). For implementation of PBM programs, 2 clinical and 3 research recommendations were developed, including recommendations to implement comprehensive PBM programs and to use electronic decision support systems (both conditional recommendations) to improve appropriate RBC utilization. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The 2018 PBM International Consensus Conference defined the current status of the PBM evidence base for practice and research purposes and established 10 clinical recommendations and 12 research recommendations for preoperative anemia, RBC transfusion thresholds for adults, and implementation of PBM programs. The relative paucity of strong evidence to answer many of the PICO questions supports the need for additional research and an international consensus for accepted definitions and hemoglobin thresholds, as well as clinically meaningful end points for multicenter trials.","[Mueller, Markus M.;

An accurate estimate of burnout prevalence among physicians would have important health policy implications, but the overall prevalence is unknown. OBJECTIVE To characterize the methods used to assess burnout and provide an estimate of the prevalence of physician burnout. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION Systematic search of EMBASE, ERIC, MEDLINE/PubMed, psycARTICLES, and psycINFO for studies on the prevalence of burnout in practicing physicians (ie, excluding physicians in training) published before June 1, 2018. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Burnout prevalence and study characteristics were extracted independently by 3 investigators. Although meta-analytic pooling was planned, variation in study designs and burnout ascertainment methods, as well as statistical heterogeneity, made quantitative pooling inappropriate. Therefore, studies were summarized descriptively and assessed qualitatively. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Point or period prevalence of burnout assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS Burnout prevalence data were extracted from 182 studies involving 109 628 individuals in 45 countries published between 1991 and 2018. In all, 85.7%(156/182) of studies used a version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) to assess burnout. Studies variably reported prevalence estimates of overall burnout or burnout subcomponents: 67.0% (122/182) on overall burnout, 72.0% (131/182) on emotional exhaustion, 68.1%(124/182) on depersonalization, and 63.2%(115/182) on low personal accomplishment. Studies used at least 142 unique definitions for meeting overall burnout or burnout subscale criteria, indicating substantial disagreement in the literature on what constituted burnout. Studies variably defined burnout based on predefined cutoff scores or sample quantiles and used markedly different cutoff definitions. Among studies using instruments based on the MBI, there were at least 47 distinct definitions of overall burnout prevalence and 29, 26, and 26 definitions of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment prevalence, respectively. Overall burnout prevalence ranged from 0% to 80.5%. Emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment prevalence ranged from 0% to 86.2%, 0% to 89.9%, and 0% to 87.1%, respectively. Because of inconsistencies in definitions of and assessment methods for burnout across studies, associations between burnout and sex, age, geography, time, specialty, and depressive symptoms could not be reliably determined. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this systematic review, there was substantial variability in prevalence estimates of burnout among practicing physicians and marked variation in burnout definitions, assessment methods, and study quality. These findings preclude definitive conclusions about the prevalence of burnout and highlight the importance of developing a consensus definition of burnout and of standardizing measurement tools to assess the effects of chronic occupational stress on physicians.","[Rotenstein, Lisa S.; Torre, Matthew; Rosales, Rachael C.; Mata, Douglas A.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA USA; [Rotenstein, Lisa S.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Rotenstein, Lisa S.; Mata, Douglas A.] Brigham Educ Inst, Boston, MA USA; [Torre, Matthew] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ramos, Marco A.] Yale Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, New Haven, CT USA; [Rosales, Rachael C.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Psychiat, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Guille, Constance] Med Univ South Carolina, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, 171 Ashley Ave, Charleston, SC 29425 USA; [Sen, Srijan] Univ Michigan, Mol & Behav Neurosci Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Sen, Srijan] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychiat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Mata, Douglas A.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Pathol, Program Mol Pathol Epidemiol, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,"Mata, DA (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Brigham Educ Inst, Dept Pathol,Program Mol Pathol Epidemiol, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",dmata@bwh.harvard.edu,"Mata, Douglas A./P-1040-2019; Rotenstein, Lisa/AAD-9280-2022; Sen, Srijan/J-8053-2013","Mata, Douglas A./0000-0002-8059-8668; Sen, Srijan/0000-0003-4495-495X",National Institutes of Health [R01MH101459]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH [R01MH101459] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)),This study received funding from the National Institutes of Health (grant R01MH101459 to Dr Sen).,,219,556,566,30,125,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

FindingsIn this systematic review and meta-analysis that included 15 systematic reviews and 115 randomized clinical trials of 28803 participants with migraine headache, multiple acute interventions, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, triptans, calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists, 5-HT1F receptor agonist, dihydroergotamine, acetaminophen, and remote electrical neuromodulation, were associated with improvements in short-term pain outcomes, with moderate to high strength of evidence. The evidence for these end points regarding opioids and other interventions was low or insufficient. MeaningFor the acute treatment of migraine, several established and newer therapies were associated with improvements in short-term pain outcomes, with varying strengths of evidence. ImportanceMigraine is common and can be associated with significant morbidity, and several treatment options exist for acute therapy. ObjectiveTo evaluate the benefits and harms associated with acute treatments for episodic migraine in adults. Data SourcesMultiple databases from database inception to February 24, 2021. Study SelectionRandomized clinical trials and systematic reviews that assessed effectiveness or harms of acute therapy for migraine attacks. Data Extraction and SynthesisIndependent reviewers selected studies and extracted data. Meta-analysis was performed with the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model with Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman variance correction or by using a fixed-effect model based on the Mantel-Haenszel method if the number of studies was small. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe main outcomes included pain freedom, pain relief, sustained pain freedom, sustained pain relief, and adverse events. The strength of evidence (SOE) was graded with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews. FindingsEvidence on triptans and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was summarized from 15 systematic reviews. For other interventions, 115 randomized clinical trials with 28803 patients were included. Compared with placebo, triptans and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs used individually were significantly associated with reduced pain at 2 hours and 1 day (moderate to high SOE) and increased risk of mild and transient adverse events. Compared with placebo, calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists (low to high SOE), lasmiditan (5-HT1F receptor agonist; high SOE), dihydroergotamine (moderate to high SOE), ergotamine plus caffeine (moderate SOE), acetaminophen (moderate SOE), antiemetics (low SOE), butorphanol (low SOE), and tramadol in combination with acetaminophen (low SOE) were significantly associated with pain reduction and increase in mild adverse events. The findings for opioids were based on low or insufficient SOE. Several nonpharmacologic treatments were significantly associated with improved pain, including remote electrical neuromodulation (moderate SOE), transcranial magnetic stimulation (low SOE), external trigeminal nerve stimulation (low SOE), and noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation (moderate SOE). No significant difference in adverse events was found between nonpharmacologic treatments and sham. Conclusions and RelevanceThere are several acute treatments for migraine, with varying strength of supporting evidence. Use of triptans, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, dihydroergotamine, calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists, lasmiditan, and some nonpharmacologic treatments was associated with improved pain and function. The evidence for many other interventions, including opioids, was limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis assesses the benefits and harms associated with acute treatments for episodic migraine, including pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies, with a focus on pain-related outcomes, function, and adverse events.",,,"Wang, Z (corresponding author), Mayo Clin, Corresponding Author, Zhen Wang, PhD, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.",wang.zhen@mayo.edu,"Rabu, Rami Abd/ACS-4894-2022","Urtecho, Meritxell/0000-0002-9123-0922",,,,,123,10,10,3,16,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Objective To update its 2008 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned reviews of the evidence on screening by asking questions about drug use and interventions for unhealthy drug use in adults and adolescents. Population This recommendation statement applies to adults 18 years or older, including pregnant and postpartum persons, and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years in primary care settings. This statement does not apply to adolescents or adults who have a currently diagnosed drug use disorder or are currently undergoing or have been referred for drug use treatment. This statement applies to settings and populations for which services for accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate care can be offered or referred. Evidence Assessment In adults, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening by asking questions about unhealthy drug use has moderate net benefit when services for accurate diagnosis of unhealthy drug use or drug use disorders, effective treatment, and appropriate care can be offered or referred. In adolescents, because of the lack of evidence, the USPSTF concludes that the benefits and harms of screening for unhealthy drug use are uncertain and that the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. Recommendation The USPSTF recommends screening by asking questions about unhealthy drug use in adults 18 years or older. Screening should be implemented when services for accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate care can be offered or referred. (Screening refers to asking questions about unhealthy drug use, not testing biological specimens.) (B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for unhealthy drug use in adolescents. (I statement) This 2020 US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement recommends screening for unhealthy drug use in adults 18 years or older when services for diagnosis, treatment, and care can be offered or referred (B recommendation) and concludes that evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for unhealthy drug use in adolescents (I statement).","[Krist, Alex H.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, 830 E Main St,One Capitol Sq,Sixth Floor, Richmond, VA 23219 USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Fairfax Family Practice Residency, Fairfax, VA USA; [Davidson, Karina W.] Northwell Hlth, Feinstein Inst Med Res, Manhasset, NY USA; [Mangione, Carol M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Barry, Michael J.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Cabana, Michael] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Caughey, Aaron B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Curry, Susan J.] Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA USA; [Donahue, Katrina] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Doubeni, Chyke A.] Mayo Clin, Rochester, MN USA; [Epling, John W., Jr.] Virginia Tech, Carilion Sch Med, Roanoke, VA USA; [Kubik, Martha] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Ogedegbe, Gbenga] NYU, New York, NY USA; [Pbert, Lori] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Worcester, MA USA; [Silverstein, Michael] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Simon, Melissa A.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Univ Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Pacific Hlth Res & Educ Inst, Honolulu, HI USA; [Wong, John B.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02111 USA",,"Krist, AH (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, 830 E Main St,One Capitol Sq,Sixth Floor, Richmond, VA 23219 USA.",chair@uspstf.net,,"Epling, John W/0000-0001-9445-8669",,,,,49,61,60,0,1,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

We aimed to review morbidity and mortality data on four overlapping populations who experience considerable social exclusion: homeless populations, individuals with substance use disorders, sex workers, and imprisoned individuals. Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies published between Jan 1, 2005, and Oct 1, 2015. We included only systematic reviews, meta-analyses, interventional studies, and observational studies that had morbidity and mortality outcomes, were published in English, from high-income countries, and were done in populations with a history of homelessness, imprisonment, sex work, or substance use disorder (excluding cannabis and alcohol use). Studies with only perinatal outcomes and studies of individuals with a specific health condition or those recruited from intensive care or high dependency hospital units were excluded. We screened studies using systematic review software and extracted data from published reports. Primary outcomes were measures of morbidity (prevalence or incidence) and mortality (standardised mortality ratios [SMRs] and mortality rates). Summary estimates were calculated using a random effects model. Findings Our search identified 7946 articles, of which 337 studies were included for analysis. All-cause standardised mortality ratios were significantly increased in 91 (99%) of 92 extracted datapoints and were 11.86 (95% CI 10.4213.30; I-2=94.1%) in female individuals and 7.88 (7.038.74; I-2=99.1%) in men. Summary SMR estimates for the International Classification of Diseases disease categories with two or more included datapoints were highest for deaths due to injury, poisoning, and other external causes, in both men (7.89; 95% CI 6.409/37; I-2=98.1%) and women (18.72; 13.7323.71; I-2=91.5%). Disease prevalence was consistently raised across the following categories: infections (eg, highest reported was 90% for hepatitis C, 67 [65%] of 103 individuals for hepatitis B, and 133 [51%] of 263 individuals for latent tuberculosis infection), mental health (eg, highest reported was 9 [4%] of 227 individuals for schizophrenia), cardiovascular conditions (eg, highest reported was 32 [13%] of 247 individuals for coronary heart disease), and respiratory conditions (eg, highest reported was 9 [26%] of 35 individuals for asthma). Interpretation Our study shows that homeless populations, individuals with substance use disorders, sex workers, and imprisoned individuals experience extreme health inequities across a wide range of health conditions, with the relative effect of exclusion being greater in female individuals than male individuals. The high heterogeneity between studies should be explored further using improved data collection in population subgroups. The extreme health inequity identified demands intensive cross-sectoral policy and service action to prevent exclusion and improve health outcomes in individuals who are already marginalised.

Preservation of kidney function can improve outcomes and can be achieved through non-pharmacological strategies (eg, dietary and lifestyle adjustments) and chronic kidney disease-targeted and kidney disease-specific pharmacological interventions. A plant-dominant, low-protein, and low-salt diet might help to mitigate glomerular hyperfiltration and preserve renal function for longer, possibly while also leading to favourable alterations in acid-base homoeostasis and in the gut microbiome. Pharmacotherapies that alter intrarenal haemodynamics (eg, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway modulators and SGLT2 [SLC5A2] inhibitors) can preserve kidney function by reducing intraglomerular pressure independently of blood pressure and glucose control, whereas other novel agents (eg, non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) might protect the kidney through anti-inflammatory or antifibrotic mechanisms. Some glomerular and cystic kidney diseases might benefit from disease-specific therapies. Managing chronic kidney disease-associated cardiovascular risk, minimising the risk of infection, and preventing acute kidney injury are crucial interventions for these patients, given the high burden of complications, associated morbidity and mortality, and the role of non-conventional risk factors in chronic kidney disease. When renal replacement therapy becomes inevitable, an incremental transition to dialysis can be considered and has been proposed to possibly preserve residual kidney function longer. There are similarities and distinctions between kidney-preserving care and supportive care. Additional studies of dietary and pharmacological interventions and development of innovative strategies are necessary to ensure optimal kidney-preserving care and to achieve greater longevity and better health-related quality of life for these patients.","[Kalantar-Zadeh, Kamyar] Univ Calif Irvine, Div Nephrol Hypertens & Kidney Transplantat, Orange, CA 92668 USA; [Kalantar-Zadeh, Kamyar] Tibor Rubin Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Long Beach, CA USA; [Jafar, Tazeen H.] Duke NUS Grad Med Sch, Singapore, Singapore; [Jafar, Tazeen H.] Singapore Gen Hosp, Dept Renal Med, Singapore, Singapore; [Jafar, Tazeen H.] Duke Global Hlth Inst, Durham, NC USA; [Nitsch, Dorothea] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, London, England; [Nitsch, Dorothea] United Kingdom Renal Registry, Bristol, Avon, England; [Nitsch, Dorothea] Royal Free London NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Nephrol, London, England; [Neuen, Brendon L.] Univ New South Wales Sydney, George Inst Global Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Perkovic, Vlado] Univ New South Wales Sydney, Fac Med, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"Kalantar-Zadeh, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Div Nephrol Hypertens & Kidney Transplantat, Orange, CA 92668 USA.",kkz@uci.edu,"Perkovic, Vlado/AAY-1933-2021; Neuen, Brendon/GLN-5967-2022; Kalantar-Zadeh, Kamyar/Q-4734-2018","Kalantar-Zadeh, Kamyar/0000-0002-8666-0725; Nitsch, Dorothea/0000-0001-5767-248X; Neuen, Brendon/0000-0001-9276-8380",Singapore National Medical Research Council [K24-DK091419]; National Institutes of Health,"Singapore National Medical Research Council(National Medical Research Council, Singapore); National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)",THJ is supported by the Singapore National Medical Research Council.

The condition was previously regarded as untreatable, but progress in understanding and management has resulted in earlier diagnosis and better treatment outcomes. A coherent syndrome of BPD typically onsets during adolescence (after age 12 years). BPD is often preceded by or co-develops with symptoms of internalising disorders (depression and anxiety), externalising disorders (conduct problems, hyperactivity, and substance use), or both. BPD is associated with various poor outcomes, including low occupational and educational attainment, lack of long-term relationships, increased partner conflict, sexual risk-taking, low levels of social support, low life satisfaction, and increased service use. Psychotherapy is the main treatment for BPD; drug treatment is only indicated for comorbid conditions that require medication, or during a crisis if psychosocial interventions are insufficient. Awareness of BPD by non-specialists, as well as specialists, is key to appropriate early intervention.","[Bohus, Martin] Heidelberg Univ, Med Fac Mannheim, Cent Inst Mental Hlth Mannheim, Inst Psychiat & Psychosomat Psychotherapy, Mannheim, Germany; [Schmahl, Christian] Heidelberg Univ, Med Fac Mannheim, Cent Inst Mental Hlth Mannheim, Dept Psychosomat Med & Psychotherapy, Mannheim, Germany; [Bohus, Martin] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Stoffers-Winterling, Jutta; Lieb, Klaus] Univ Med Ctr Mainz, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, D-55131 Mainz, Germany; [Stoffers-Winterling, Jutta; Lieb, Klaus] Leibniz Inst Resilience Res, Mainz, Germany; [Sharp, Carla] Univ Houston, Dept Psychol, Houston, TX USA; [Krause-Utz, Annegret] Leiden Univ, Dept Clin Psychol, Leiden, Netherlands; [Krause-Utz, Annegret] Leiden Inst Brain & Cognit, Leiden, Netherlands",,"Lieb, K (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Mainz, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, D-55131 Mainz, Germany.",klaus.lieb@unimedizin-mainz.de,,,,,,,146,10,10,25,28,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,OCT 23,2021,398,10310,,,,,1528,1540,,,,,,13,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,WL9OA,34688371,,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000710725800027,View Full Record in Web of Science,1735,1,18,105,132,17,40,14,140,122,110,109,134,87,74,53,85

In men and nonpregnant women with diabetes who are otherwise healthy, most professional societies recommend a glycated hemoglobin level below 6.5% or 7.0%. However, glycemic targets should be individualized according to other factors (e.g., risk of hypoglycemia, coexisting conditions, and patient preferences). Along with lifestyle recommendations, the standard initial pharmacologic treatment used in patients with type 2 diabetes is metformin. Assessment of cardiovascular disease status and risk factors is critical in guiding the selection of additional glucose-lowering therapy to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. The treatment of patients with diabetes and established cardiovascular disease (and in selected patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease) should include a glucose-lowering medication with demonstrated cardiovascular benefit, including specific agents from the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist or sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor classes. For patients with type 2 diabetes who have a history of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, SGLT2 inhibitors with demonstrated benefit in heart failure are recommended. In patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease (or in those with a high risk of cardiovascular disease) in whom glycemic goals are not achieved with metformin, agents from the GLP-1 receptor agonist or SGLT2 inhibitor classes with demonstrated cardiovascular benefit constitute the recommended treatment.","[Kalyani, Rita R.] Johns Hopkins Univ Sch Med, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, Baltimore, MD USA",,"Kalyani, RR (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ Sch Med, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, Dept Med, 1830 E Monument St,Ste 333, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA.",rrastogi@jhmi.edu,,,,,,,53,28,29,28,56,MASSACHUSETTS MEDICAL SOC,WALTHAM,"WALTHAM WOODS CENTER, 860 WINTER ST,, WALTHAM, MA 02451-1413 USA",0028-4793,1533-4406,,NEW ENGL J MED,N.

Importance Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common chronic blood-borne pathogen in the US and a leading cause of complications from chronic liver disease. HCV is associated with more deaths than the top 60 other reportable infectious diseases combined, including HIV. Cases of acute HCV infection have increased approximately 3.8-fold over the last decade because of increasing injection drug use and improved surveillance. Objective To update its 2013 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on screening for HCV infection in adolescents and adults. Population This recommendation applies to all asymptomatic adults aged 18 to 79 years without known liver disease. Evidence Assessment The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for HCV infection in adults aged 18 to 79 years has substantial net benefit. Recommendation The USPSTF recommends screening for HCV infection in adults aged 18 to 79 years.

The masterplan described is based on regional, geographically sited liver centres, each linked to four to six surrounding district general hospitals-a pattern of care similar to that successfully introduced for stroke services. The plan includes the establishment of a lead and deputy lead clinician in each acute hospital, preferably a hepatologist or gastroenterologist with a special interest in liver disease, who will have prime responsibility for organising the care of admitted patients with liver disease on a 24/7 basis. Essential for the plan is greater access to intensive care units and high-dependency units, in line with the reconfiguration of emergency care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This Review strongly recommends full implementation of alcohol care teams in hospitals and improved working links with acute medical services. We also endorse recommendations from paediatric liver services to improve overall survival figures by diagnosing biliary atresia earlier based on stool colour charts and better caring for patients with impaired cognitive ability and developmental mental health problems. Pilot studies of earlier diagnosis have shown encouraging progress, with 5-6% of previously undiagnosed cases of severe fibrosis or cirrhosis identified through use of a portable FibroScan in primary care. Similar approaches to the detection of early asymptomatic disease are described in accounts from the devolved nations, and the potential of digital technology in improving the value of clinical consultation and screening programmes in primary care is highlighted. The striking contribution of comorbidities, particularly obesity and diabetes (with excess alcohol consumption known to be a major factor in obesity), to mortality in COVID-19 reinforces the need for fiscal and other long delayed regulatory measures to reduce the prevalence of obesity. These measures include the food sugar levy and the introduction of the minimum unit price policy to reduce alcohol consumption. Improving public health, this Review emphasises, will not only mitigate the severity of further waves of COVID-19, but is crucial to reducing the unacceptable burden from liver disease in the UK.","[Williams, Roger;

Maintenance treatment with antipsychotic drugs can prevent relapse but also causes side-effects. We aimed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of antipsychotics as maintenance treatment for non-treatment resistant patients with schizophrenia. Methods In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched, without language restrictions, the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's specialised register between database inception and April 27, 2020, PubMed from April 1, 2020, to Jan 15, 2021, and the lists of included studies from related systematic reviews. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs; =12 weeks of follow-up) that recruited adult participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with stable symptoms who were treated with antipsychotics (monotherapy; oral or long-acting injectable) or placebo. We excluded RCTs of participants with specific comorbidities or treatment resistance. In duplicate, two authors independently selected eligible RCTs and extracted aggregate data. The primary outcome was the number of participants who relapsed and was analysed by random-effects, Bayesian network meta-analyses. The study was registered on PROSPERO, CRD42016049022. Findings We identified 4157 references through our search, from which 501 references on 127 RCTs of 32 antipsychotics (comprising 18 152 participants) were included. 100 studies including 16 812 participants and 30 antipsychotics contributed to our network meta-analysis of the primary outcome. All antipsychotics had risk ratios (RRs) less than 1.00 when compared with placebo for relapse prevention and almost all had 95% credible intervals (CrIs) excluding no effect. RRs ranged from 0.20 (95% CrI 0.05-0.41) for paliperidone oral to 0.65 (0.16-1.14) for cariprazine oral (moderate-to-low confidence in estimates). Generally, we interpret that there was no clear evidence for the superiority of specific antipsychotics in terms of relapse prevention because most comparisons between antipsychotics included a probability of no difference. Interpretation As we found no clear differences between antipsychotics for relapse prevention, we conclude that the choice of antipsychotic for maintenance treatment should be guided mainly by their tolerability.

These advances have introduced personalised therapeutics to clinical practice, with treatments targeting genomic alterations in DNA repair pathways now clinically validated. An important shift in the therapeutic framework for metastatic disease has taken place, with metastatic-directed therapies being evaluated for oligometastatic disease, aggressive management of the primary lesion shown to benefit patients with low-volume metastatic disease, and with several novel androgen pathway inhibitors significantly improving survival when used as a first-line therapy for metastatic disease. Research into the molecular characterisation of localised, recurrent, and progressive disease will undoubtedly have an impact on clinical management.

Most acute lymphoblastic leukaemia arises in healthy individuals, and predisposing factors such as inherited genetic susceptibility or environmental exposure have been identified in only a few patients. It is characterised by chromosomal abnormalities and genetic alterations involved in differentiation and proliferation of lymphoid precursor cells. Along with response to treatment, these abnormalities are important prognostic factors. Disease-risk stratification and the development of intensified chemotherapy protocols substantially improves the outcome of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, particularly in children (1-14 years), but also in adolescents and young adults (15-39 years). However, the outcome of older adults (>= 40 years) and patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia remains poor. New immunotherapeutic strategies, such as monoclonal antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, are being developed and over the next few years could change the options for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treatment.","[Malard, Florent; Mohty, Mohamad] Sorbonne Univ, St Antoine Hosp, AP HP, Dept Clin Hematol & Cellular Therapy, F-75012 Paris, France; [Malard, Florent; Mohty, Mohamad] Sorbonne Univ, INSERM, St Antoine Res Ctr, Paris, France",,"Mohty, M (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, St Antoine Hosp, AP HP, Dept Clin Hematol & Cellular Therapy, F-75012 Paris, France.",mohamad.mohty@inserm.fr,,,,,,,175,149,157,24,96,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,APR 4,2020,395,10230,,,,,1146,1162,,,,,,17,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,KZ9LJ,32247396,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000523580400028,View Full Record in Web of Science,2763,1,14,76,43,56,6,25,24,62,69,111,50,39,55,97,120

Its incidence has a bimodal distribution with the highest risk in infants and older age groups. Progress in genomic technology is exposing the complex genetic architecture of the common types of epilepsy, and is driving a paradigm shift. Epilepsy is a symptom complex with multiple risk factors and a strong genetic predisposition rather than a condition with a single expression and cause. These advances have resulted in the new classification of epileptic seizures and epilepsies. A detailed clinical history and a reliable eyewitness account of a seizure are the cornerstones of the diagnosis. Ancillary investigations can help to determine cause and prognosis. Advances in brain imaging are helping to identify the structural and functional causes and consequences of the epilepsies. Comorbidities are increasingly recognised as important aetiological and prognostic markers. Antiseizure medication might suppress seizures in up to two-thirds of all individuals but do not alter long-term prognosis. Epilepsy surgery is the most effective way to achieve long-term seizure freedom in selected individuals with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, but it is probably not used enough. With improved understanding of the gradual development of epilepsy, epigenetic determinants, and pharmacogenomics comes the hope for better, disease-modifying, or even curative, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment strategies. Other developments are clinical implementation of seizure detection devices and new neuromodulation techniques, including responsive neural stimulation.","[Thijs, Roland D.; Sander, Josemir W.] SEIN, Heemstede, Netherlands; [Thijs, Roland D.] Leiden Univ, Dept Neurol, Med Ctr, Leiden, Netherlands; [Thijs, Roland D.; Sander, Josemir W.] UCL Queen Sq Inst Neurol, NIHR Univ Coll London Hosp Biomed Res Ctr, London, England; [Surges, Rainer] Univ Hosp RWTH Aachen, Sect Epileptol, Dept Neurol, Aachen, Germany; [O'Brien, Terence J.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Brain Ctr, Dept Med, Royal Melbourne Hosp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [O'Brien, Terence J.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Brain Ctr, Dept Neurol, Royal Melbourne Hosp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [O'Brien, Terence J.] Monash Univ, Dept Neurosci & Neurol, Cent Clin Sch, Alfred Hosp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Sander, Josemir W.] Chalfont Ctr Epilepsy, Gerrards Cross, England",,"Sander, JW (corresponding author), UCL Queen Sq Inst Neurol, Box 29, London WC1N 3BG, England.",l.sander@ucl.ac.uk,"O'Brien, Terence/AAU-5525-2021; O'Brien, Terence/L-8102-2013; Thijs, Roland D/AGE-5180-2022; Sander, Ley/C-1576-2008","Thijs, Roland D/0000-0003-1435-8970; Sander, Ley/0000-0001-6041-9661; O'Brien, Terence/0000-0002-7198-8621","Dutch National Epilepsy Fund [15-10]; AC Thomson Foundation; Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development; Christelijke Vereniging voor de Verpleging van Lijders aan Epilepsie, The Netherlands; Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Boll Foundation (Kerpen, Germany); National Health and Medical Research Council, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; Royal Melbourne Hospital Neuroscience Foundation; UK Department of Health's Research Centres; Marvin Weil Epilepsy Research Fund; UK Epilepsy Society; Nuts Ohra Fund; Monash University","Dutch National Epilepsy Fund; AC Thomson Foundation; Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development(Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development); Christelijke Vereniging voor de Verpleging van Lijders aan Epilepsie, The Netherlands(Netherlands Government); Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Boll Foundation (Kerpen, Germany); National Health and Medical Research Council, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke; Royal Melbourne Hospital Neuroscience Foundation; UK Department of Health's Research Centres; Marvin Weil Epilepsy Research Fund; UK Epilepsy Society; Nuts Ohra Fund; Monash University(Monash University)","RDT receives research support from the Dutch National Epilepsy Fund (15-10), Nuts Ohra Fund, AC Thomson Foundation, The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development, and the Christelijke Vereniging voor de Verpleging van Lijders aan Epilepsie, The Netherlands.

The epidemic has been stubbornly persistent; high incidence densities have been sustained over decades and the epidemic is increasingly concentrated among racial, ethnic, and sexual and gender minority communities. This fact remains true despite extraordinary scientific advances in prevention, treatment, and care-advances that have been led, to a substantial degree, by US-supported science and researchers. In this watershed year of 2021 and in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is clear that the USA will not meet the stated goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, particularly those goals relating to reductions in new infections, decreases in morbidity, and reductions in HIV stigma. The six papers in the Lancet Series on HIV in the USA have each examined the underlying causes of these challenges and laid out paths forward for an invigorated, sustained, and more equitable response to the US HIV epidemic than has been seen to date. The sciences of HIV surveillance, prevention, treatment, and implementation all suggest that the visionary goals of the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative in the USA might be achievable.

Study Selection Fair- to good-quality English-language studies of cognitive impairment screening instruments, and pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments aimed at persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mild to moderate dementia, or their caregivers. Data Extraction and Synthesis Independent critical appraisal and data abstraction; random-effects meta-analyses and qualitative synthesis. Main Outcomes and Measures Sensitivity, specificity; patient, caregiver, and clinician decision-making; patient function, quality of life, and neuropsychiatric symptoms; caregiver burden and well-being. Results The review included 287 studies with more than 280 & x202f;000 older adults. One randomized clinical trial (RCT) (n = 4005) examined the direct effect of screening for cognitive impairment on patient outcomes, including potential harms, finding no significant differences in health-related quality of life at 12 months (effect size, 0.009 [95% CI, -0.063 to 0.080]). Fifty-nine studies (n = 38 & x202f;531) addressed the accuracy of 49 screening instruments to detect cognitive impairment. The Mini-Mental State Examination was the most-studied instrument, with a pooled sensitivity of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85 to 0.92) and specificity of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85 to 0.93) to detect dementia using a cutoff of 23 or less or 24 or less (15 studies, n = 12 & x202f;796). Two hundred twenty-four RCTs and 3 observational studies including more than 240 & x202f;000 patients or caregivers addressed the treatment of MCI or mild to moderate dementia. None of the treatment trials were linked with a screening program; in all cases, participants were persons with known cognitive impairment. Medications approved to treat Alzheimer disease (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and memantine) improved scores on the ADAS-Cog 11 by 1 to 2.5 points over 3 months to 3 years. Psychoeducation interventions for caregivers resulted in a small benefit for caregiver burden (standardized mean difference, -0.24 [95% CI, -0.36 to -0.13) over 3 to 12 months. Intervention benefits were small and of uncertain clinical importance. Conclusions and Relevance Screening instruments can adequately detect cognitive impairment. There is no empirical evidence, however, that screening for cognitive impairment improves patient or caregiver outcomes or causes harm. It remains unclear whether interventions for patients or caregivers provide clinically important benefits for older adults with earlier detected cognitive impairment or their caregivers. This systematic review to support the 2020 US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement on screening for cognitive impairment in older adults summarizes published evidence on the benefits and harms of cognitive impairment screening and treatment in adults 65 years or older.","[Patnode, Carrie D.; Perdue, Leslie A.; Rushkin, Megan C.; Redmond, Nadia; Thomas, Rachel G.; Lin, Jennifer S.] Kaiser Permanente, Ctr Hlth Res, Kaiser Permanente Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Portland, OR USA; [Rossom, Rebecca C.] HealthPartners Inst, Minneapolis, MN USA",,"Patnode, CD (corresponding author), Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Ctr Hlth Res, Kaiser Permanente Evidence Based Practice Ctr, 3800 N Interstate Ave, Portland, OR 97227 USA.",carrie.d.patnode@kpchr.org,,"Rossom, Rebecca/0000-0002-9531-914X","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA-290-2015-00007-I-EPC5]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA-290-2015-00007-I-EPC5, Task Order 3, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).",,311,57,61,3,19,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

A variety of insults to liver cells result in a consistent pattern of rapid-onset elevation of aminotransferases, altered mentation, and disturbed coagulation. The absence of existing liver disease distinguishes acute liver failure from decompensated cirrhosis or acute-on-chronic liver failure. Causes of acute liver failure include paracetamol toxicity, hepatic ischaemia, viral and autoimmune hepatitis, and drug-induced liver injury from prescription drugs, and herbal and dietary supplements. Diagnosis requires careful review of medications taken, and serological testing for possible viral exposure. Because of its rarity, acute liver failure has not been studied in large, randomised trials, and most treatment recommendations represent expert opinion. Improvements in management have resulted in lower mortality, although liver transplantation, used in nearly 30% of patients with acute liver failure, still provides a life-saving alternative to medical management.","[Stravitz, R.

MS affects an estimated 900 000 people in the US. MS typically presents in young adults (mean age of onset, 20-30 years) and can lead to physical disability, cognitive impairment, and decreased quality of life. This review summarizes current evidence regarding diagnosis and treatment of MS. OBSERVATIONS MS typically presents in young adults aged 20 to 30 years with unilateral optic neuritis, partial myelitis, sensory disturbances, or brainstem syndromes such as internuclear ophthalmoplegia developing over several days. The prevalence of MS worldwide ranges from 5 to 300 per 100 000 people and increases at higher latitudes. Overall life expectancy is less than in the general population (75.9 vs 83.4 years), and MS more commonly affects women (female to male sex distribution of nearly 3:1). Diagnosis is made based on a combination of signs and symptoms, radiographic findings (eg, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] T2 lesions), and laboratory findings (eg, cerebrospinal fluid-specific oligoclonal bands), which are components of the 2017 McDonald Criteria. Nine classes of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), with varying mechanisms of action and routes of administration, are available for relapsing-remitting MS, defined as relapses at onset with stable neurologic disability between episodes, and secondary progressive MS with activity, defined as steadily increasing neurologic disability following a relapsing course with evidence of ongoing inflammatory activity. These drugs include interferons, glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators, fumarates, cladribine, and 3 types of monoclonal antibodies. One additional DMT, ocrelizumab, is approved for primary progressive MS. These DMTs reduce clinical relapses and MRI lesions (new T2 lesions, gadolinium-enhancing lesions). Efficacy rates of current DMTs, defined by reduction in annualized relapse rates compared with placebo or active comparators, range from 29%-68%. Adverse effects include infections, bradycardia, heart blocks, macular edema, infusion reactions, injection-site reactions, and secondary autoimmune adverse effects, such as autoimmune thyroid disease. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE MS is characterized by physical disability, cognitive impairment, and other symptoms that affect quality of life. Treatment with DMT can reduce the annual relapse rate by 29% to 68% compared with placebo or active comparator.","[McGinley, Marisa P.; Goldschmidt, Carolyn H.; Rae-Grant, Alexander D.] Cleveland Clin, Mellen Ctr, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Rae-Grant, Alexander D.] Cleveland Clin, Lerner Coll Med, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",,"Rae-Grant, AD (corresponding author), 10 Estes St, Ipswich, MA 01938 USA.",raegranta@gmail.com,,,,,,,106,97,97,27,51,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL (2010 toMay 2020), ClinicalTrials.gov, reference lists; surveillance through June 2021. STUDY SELECTION English-language intervention studies for screening and treatment; observational studies on screening; prospective studies on screening test accuracy. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Dual review of titles/abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality. Single-reviewer data abstraction with verification. Random-effects meta-analysis or bivariate analysis (accuracy). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Pregnancy, fetal/neonatal, and long-term health outcomes; harms of screening; accuracy. RESULTS A total of 76 studies were included (18 randomized clinical trials [RCTs] [n = 31 241], 2 nonrandomized intervention studies [n = 190], 56 observational studies [n = 261 678]). Direct evidence on benefits of screening vs no screening was limited to 4 observational studies with inconsistent findings and methodological limitations. Screening was not significantly associated with serious or long-term harm. In 5 RCTs (n = 25 772), 1-step (International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group) vs 2-step (Carpenter and Coustan) screening was significantly associated with increased likelihood of gestational diabetes (11.5% vs 4.9%) but no improved health outcomes. At or after 24 weeks of gestation, oral glucose challenge tests with 140- and 135-mg/dL cutoffs had sensitivities of 82% and 93%, respectively, and specificities of 82% and 79%, respectively, against Carpenter and Coustan criteria, and a test with a 140-mg/dL cutoff had sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 81% against the National Diabetes Group Data criteria. Fasting plasma glucose tests with cutoffs of 85 and 90mg/dL had sensitivities of 88% and 81% and specificities of 73% and 82%, respectively, against Carpenter and Coustan criteria. Based on 8 RCTs and 1 nonrandomized study (n = 3982), treatment was significantly associated with decreased risk of primary cesarean deliveries (relative risk [RR], 0.70 [95% CI, 0.54-0.91]; absolute risk difference [ARD], 5.3%), shoulder dystocia (RR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.23-0.77]; ARD, 1.3%), macrosomia (RR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.41-0.68]; ARD, 8.9%), large for gestational age (RR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.47-0.66]; ARD, 8.4%), birth injuries (odds ratio, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.11-0.99]; ARD, 0.2%), and neonatal intensive care unit admissions (RR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.53-0.99]; ARD, 2.0%). The association with reduction in preterm deliveries was not significant (RR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.56-1.01]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Direct evidence on screening vs no screening remains limited. One- vs 2-step screening was not significantly associated with improved health outcomes. At or after 24 weeks of gestation, treatment of gestational diabetes was significantly associated with improved health outcomes.","[Pillay, Jennifer; Guitard, Samantha; Zakher, Bernadette; Gates, Michelle; Gates, Allison; Vandermeer, Ben; Hartling, Lisa] Univ Alberta, Univ Alberta Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Dept Pediat, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Donovan, Lois] Univ Calgary, Fac Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Donovan, Lois] Univ Calgary, Fac Med, Dept Med, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Bougatsos, Christina; Chou, Roger] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Pacific Northwest Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Dept Med Informat & Clin Epidemiol, Portland, OR 97201 USA",,"Pillay, J (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Pediat, 4-488D Edmonton Clin Hlth Acad,11405 87 Ave, Edmonton, AB T6G 1C9, Canada.",jpillay@ualberta.ca,,,,,,,109,12,12,1,4,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Person-to-person transmission occurs via direct contact or through dispersion of respiratory droplets from a carrier of the bacteria, and can lead to invasive meningococcal disease. Rare sporadic cases of meningococcal urogenital and anorectal infections, including urethritis, proctitis, and cervicitis, have been reported, typically following orogenital contact with an oropharyngeal meningococcal carrier. The resulting infections were clinically indistinguishable from infections caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Over the past two decades, there have also been multiple outbreaks across North America and Europe of invasive meningococcal disease among men who have sex with men (MSM). The responsible meningococci belong to a highly virulent and predominantly serogroup C lineage, including strains that are able to express nitrite reductase and grow in anaerobic environments, such as the urogenital and anorectal tracts. More recently, a distinct clade within this lineage has expanded to cause urethritis predominantly among men who have sex with women. Evolutionary events giving rise to this clade included the loss of the ability to express a capsule, and acquisition of several gonococcal alleles, including one allele encoding a highly efficient gonococcal nitrite reductase.

OBSERVATIONS The clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis is based on history and physical, laboratory evaluation, and imaging. Classic symptoms of appendicitis include vague periumbilical pain, anorexia/nausea/intermittent vomiting, migration of pain to the right lower quadrant, and low-grade fever. The diagnosis of acute appendicitis is made in approximately 90% of patients presenting with these symptoms. Laparoscopic appendectomy remains the most common treatment. However, increasing evidence suggests that broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as piperacillin-tazobactam monotherapy or combination therapy with either cephalosporins or fluroquinolones with metronidazole, successfully treats uncomplicated acute appendicitis in approximately 70% of patients. Specific imaging findings on computed tomography (CT), such as appendiceal dilatation (appendiceal diameter >= 7 mm), or presence of appendicoliths, defined as the conglomeration of feces in the appendiceal lumen, identify patients for whom an antibiotics-first management strategy is more likely to fail. CT findings of appendicolith, mass effect, and a dilated appendix greater than 13 mm are associated with higher risk of treatment failure (approximate to 40%) of an antibiotics-first approach. Therefore, surgical management should be recommended in patients with CT findings of appendicolith, mass effect, or a dilated appendix who are fit for surgery, defined as having relatively low risk of adverse outcomes or postoperative mortality and morbidity. In patients without high-risk CT findings, either appendectomy or antibiotics can be considered as first-line therapy. In unfit patients without these high-risk CT findings, the antibiotics-first approach is recommended, and surgery may be considered if antibiotic treatment fails. In unfit patients with high-risk CT findings, perioperative risk assessment as well as patient preferences should be considered. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Acute appendicitis affects 96.5 to 100 people per 100 000 adults per year worldwide. Appendectomy remains first-line therapy for acute appendicitis, but treatment with antibiotics rather than surgery is appropriate in selected patients with uncomplicated appendicitis.","[Moris, Dimitrios; Pappas, Theodore N.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Surg, 2301 Erwin Rd, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Paulson, Erik Karl] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Radiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA",,"Pappas, TN (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Surg, 2301 Erwin Rd, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",theodore.pappas@duke.edu,,"Moris, Dimitrios/0000-0002-5276-0699; Pappas, Theodore/0000-0001-9110-4849",,,,,95,5,5,4,4,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

CRDs are strongly associated with poverty, infectious diseases, and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and contribute to complex multi-morbidity, with major consequences for the lives and livelihoods of those affected. The relevance of CRDs to health and socioeconomic wellbeing is expected to increase in the decades ahead, as life expectancies rise and the competing risks of early childhood mortality and infectious diseases plateau. As such, the World Health Organization has identified the prevention and control of NCDs as an urgent development issue and essential to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. In this Review, we focus on CRDs in LMICs. We discuss the early life origins of CRDs; challenges in their prevention, diagnosis, and management in LMICs; and pathways to solutions to achieve true universal health coverage.","[Meghji, Jamilah; Mortimer, Kevin] Univ Liverpool Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Dept Clin Sci, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England; [Mortimer, Kevin; Bateman, Eric D.; Cruz, Alvaro A.; Reddel, Helen K.] Global Initiat Asthma GINA, Fontana, WI USA; [Mortimer, Kevin; Agusti, Alvar; Celli, Bartolome; Halpin, David M.

Each year, an estimated 605 000 people in the US have a first myocardial infarction and an estimated 610 000 experience a first stroke. OBJECTIVE To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on the effectiveness of aspirin to reduce the risk of CVD events (myocardial infarction and stroke), cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality in persons without a history of CVD. The systematic review also investigated the effect of aspirin use on colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality in primary CVD prevention populations, as well as the harms (particularly bleeding) associated with aspirin use. The USPSTF also commissioned a microsimulation modeling study to assess the net balance of benefits and harms from aspirin use for primary prevention of CVD and CRC, stratified by age, sex, and CVD risk level. POPULATION Adults 40 years or older without signs or symptoms of CVD or known CVD (including history of myocardial infarction or stroke) who are not at increased risk for bleeding (eg, no history of gastrointestinal ulcers, recent bleeding, other medical conditions, or use of medications that increase bleeding risk). EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk has a small net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults 60 years or older has no net benefit. RECOMMENDATION The decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk should be an individual one. Evidence indicates that the net benefit of aspirin use in this group is small. Persons who are not at increased risk for bleeding and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily are more likely to benefit. (C recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults 60 years or older.

OBJECTIVE To update the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2012 recommendation on screening for cervical cancer. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for cervical cancer, with a focus on clinical trials and cohort studies that evaluated screening with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing alone or hrHPV and cytology together (cotesting) compared with cervical cytology alone. The USPSTF also commissioned a decision analysis model to evaluate the age at which to begin and end screening, the optimal interval for screening, the effectiveness of different screening strategies, and related benefits and harms of different screening strategies. FINDINGS Screening with cervical cytology alone, primary hrHPV testing alone, or cotesting can detect high-grade precancerous cervical lesions and cervical cancer. Screening women aged 21 to 65 years substantially reduces cervical cancer incidence and mortality. The harms of screening for cervical cancer in women aged 30 to 65 years are moderate. The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the benefits of screening every 3 years with cytology alone in women aged 21 to 29 years substantially outweigh the harms. The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the benefits of screening every 3 years with cytology alone, every 5 years with hrHPV testing alone, or every 5 years with both tests (cotesting) in women aged 30 to 65 years outweigh the harms. Screening women older than 65 years who have had adequate prior screening and women younger than 21 years does not provide significant benefit. Screening women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix for indications other than a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer provides no benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate to high certainty that screening women older than 65 years who have had adequate prior screening and are not otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer, screening women younger than 21 years, and screening women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix for indications other than a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer does not result in a positive net benefit. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF recommends screening for cervical cancer every 3 years with cervical cytology alone inwomen aged 21 to 29 years. (A recommendation) The USPSTF recommends screening every 3 years with cervical cytology alone, every 5 years with hrHPV testing alone, or every 5 years with hrHPV testing in combination with cytology (cotesting) inwomen aged 30 to 65 years. (A recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against screening for cervical cancer inwomen younger than 21 years. (D recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against screening for cervical cancer inwomen older than 65 years who have had adequate prior screening and are not otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer.

OBJECTIVES To estimate the relative likelihood of hemodynamically significant PDA closure with common pharmacotherapeutic interventions and to compare adverse event rates. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION The databases of MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception until August 15, 2015, and updated on December 31, 2017, along with conference proceedings up to December 2017. Randomized clinical trials that enrolled preterm infants with a gestational age younger than 37 weeks treated with intravenous or oral indomethacin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen vs each other, placebo, or no treatment for a clinically or echocardiographically diagnosed hemodynamically significant PDA. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were independently extracted in pairs by 6 reviewers and synthesized with Bayesian random-effects network meta-analyses. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome: hemodynamically significant PDA closure; secondary: included surgical closure, mortality, necrotizing enterocolitis, and intraventricular hemorrhage. RESULTS In 68 randomized clinical trials of 4802 infants, 14 different variations of indomethacin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen were used as treatment modalities. The overall PDA closure rate was 67.4%(2867 of 4256 infants). A high dose of oral ibuprofen was associated with a significantly higher odds of PDA closure vs a standard dose of intravenous ibuprofen (odds ratio [OR], 3.59; 95% credible interval [CrI], 1.64-8.17; absolute risk difference, 199 [95% CrI, 95-258] more per 1000 infants) and a standard dose of intravenous indomethacin (OR, 2.35 [95% CrI, 1.08-5.31]; absolute risk difference, 124 [95% CrI, 14-188] more per 1000 infants). Based on the ranking statistics, a high dose of oral ibuprofen ranked as the best pharmacotherapeutic option for PDA closure (mean surface under the cumulative ranking [SUCRA] curve, 0.89 [SD, 0.12]) and to prevent surgical PDA ligation (mean SUCRA, 0.98 [SD, 0.08]). There was no significant difference in the odds of mortality, necrotizing enterocolitis, or intraventricular hemorrhage with use of placebo or no treatment compared with any of the other treatment modalities. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A high dose of oral ibuprofen was associated with a higher likelihood of hemodynamically significant PDA closure vs standard doses of intravenous ibuprofen or intravenous indomethacin; placebo or no treatment did not significantly change the likelihood of mortality, necrotizing enterocolitis, or intraventricular hemorrhage.","[Mitra, Souvik] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Pediat, Div Neonatal Perinatal Med, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Mitra, Souvik] IWK Hlth Ctr, G-2214,5850-5980 Univ Ave, Halifax, NS B3K 6R8, Canada; [Mitra, Souvik; Florez, Ivan D.; Mbuagbaw, Lawrence; Vanniyasingam, Thuva; Zea, Adriana M.; Zhang, Yuan; Sadeghirad, Behnam; Thabane, Lehana] McMaster Univ, Dept Hlth Res Methods Evidence & Impact, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Florez, Ivan D.; Tamayo, Maria E.] Univ Antioquia, Dept Pediat, Medellin, Colombia; [Mbuagbaw, Lawrence; Vanniyasingam, Thuva] St Josephs Healthcare Hamilton, Father Sean OSullivan Res Ctr, Biostat Unit, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Veroniki, Areti Angeliki] St Michaels Hosp, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Sadeghirad, Behnam] Kerman Univ Med Sci, HIV STI Surveillance Res Ctr, Kerman, Iran; [Sadeghirad, Behnam] Kerman Univ Med Sci, WHO Collaborating Ctr HIV Surveillance, Kerman, Iran; [Sadeghirad, Behnam] Kerman Univ Med Sci, Inst Futures Studies Hlth, Kerman, Iran; [Sadeghirad, Behnam] McMaster Univ, Michael G DeGroote Inst Pain Res & Care, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Thabane, Lehana] McMaster Univ, Dept Pediat & Anesthesia, Hamilton, ON, Canada",,"Mitra, S (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Dept Pediat, G-2214,5850-5980 Univ Ave, Halifax, NS B3K 6R8, Canada.;Mitra, S (corresponding author), IWK Hlth Ctr, G-2214,5850-5980 Univ Ave, Halifax, NS B3K 6R8, Canada.",souvik.mitra@iwk.nshealth.ca,"Sadeghirad, Behnam/A-1772-2009; Mbuagbaw, Lawrence/D-9381-2015; Florez, Ivan D./K-3536-2015","Sadeghirad, Behnam/0000-0001-9422-5232; Mbuagbaw, Lawrence/0000-0001-5855-5461; Florez, Ivan D./0000-0002-0751-8932; /0000-0001-6388-4825; Vanniyasingam, Thuva/0000-0002-4662-0083",,,,,115,118,119,5,33,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Histiocytoses can start at any age. Diagnosis is based on histology in combination with appropriate clinical and radiological findings. The low incidence and broad spectrum of clinical manifestations often leads to diagnostic delay, especially for adults. In most cases, biopsy specimens infiltrated by histiocytes have somatic mutations in genes activating the MAP kinase cell-signalling pathway. These mutations might also be present in blood cells and haematopoietic progenitors of patients with multisystem disease. A comprehensive range of investigations and molecular typing are essential to accurately predict prognosis, which can vary from spontaneous resolution to life-threatening disseminated disease. Targeted therapies with BRAF or MEK inhibitors have revolutionised salvage treatment. However, the type and duration of treatment are still debated, and the prevention of neurological sequelae remains a crucial issue.","[Emile, Jean-Francois; Donadieu, Jean] Univ Versailles SQY, Hop Ambroise Pare, AP HP, EA4340 BECCOH,Serv Pathol, Boulogne, France; [Donadieu, Jean] Hop Armand Trousseau, AP HP, Serv Hematol Oncol Pediat, Ctr Reference Histiocytoses, Paris, France; [Cohen-Aubart, Fleur; Haroche, Julien] Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, AP HP, Internal Med Dept 2, French Natl Referral Ctr Rare Syst Dis & Histiocy, Paris, France; [Cohen-Aubart, Fleur; Idbaih, Ahmed; Haroche, Julien] Sorbonne Univ, Paris, France; [Collin, Matthew] Newcastle Univ, Translat & Clin Res Inst, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Fraitag, Sylvie] Necker Enfants Malad Hosp, AP HP, Pathol Dept, Paris, France; [Idbaih, Ahmed] Hop Univ La Pitie Salpetriere Charles Foix, AP HP, UMR S 1127, CNRS,INSERM,Inst Cerveau & Moelle Epiniere, Paris, France; [Abdel-Wahab, Omar] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Human Oncol & Pathogenesis Program, Dept Med, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Rollins, Barrett J.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Rollins, Barrett J.] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,"Emile, JF (corresponding author), Hop Ambroise Pare, Serv Pathol, EA4340 BECCOH, F-92104 Boulogne, France.",jean-francois.emile@uvsq.fr,,,Programme de Recherche Translationnelle en Cancerologie [19-143]; Association pour le Recherche et l'Enseignement en Pathologie,Programme de Recherche Translationnelle en Cancerologie; Association pour le Recherche et l'Enseignement en Pathologie,"We thank the physicians who provided clinical or metabolic pictures of histiocytoses (A Aouba, D Bessis, C Bodemer, F Cambazard, P Maksud, V Pallure, and O Sangueza), as well as Janet Jacobson for editorial assistance.

Alcohol use disorders are some of the most prevalent mental disorders globally, especially in high-income and upper-middle-income countries; and are associated with high mortality and burden of disease, mainly due to medical consequences, such as liver cirrhosis or injury. Despite their high prevalence, alcohol use disorders are undertreated partly because of the high stigma associated with them, but also because of insufficient systematic screening in primary health care, although effective and cost-effective psychosocial and pharmacological interventions do exist. Primary health care should be responsible for most treatment, with routine screening for alcohol use, and the provision of a staggered treatment response, from brief advice to pharmacological treatment. Clinical interventions for these disorders should be embedded in a supportive environment, which can be bolstered by the creation of alcohol control policies aimed at reducing the overall level of consumption.","[Carvalho, Andre F.; Probst, Charlotte; Rehm, Jurgen] Ctr Addict & Mental Hlth, Inst Mental Hlth Policy Res, Toronto, ON M5S 2S1, Canada; [Carvalho, Andre F.; Rehm, Jurgen] Univ Toronto, Dept Psychiat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Rehm, Jurgen] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Rehm, Jurgen] Univ Toronto, Inst Med Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Heilig, Markus] Linkoping Univ, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Ctr Social & Affect Neurosci, Linkoping, Sweden; [Perez, Augusto] Corp Nuevos Rumbos, Bogota, Colombia; [Rehm, Jurgen] Ctr Addict & Mental Hlth, Campbell Family Mental Hlth Res Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Rehm, Jurgen] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Clin Psychol & Psychotherapy, Dresden, Germany; [Rehm, Jurgen] Tech Univ Dresden, Ctr Clin Epidemiol & Longitudinal Studies, Dresden, Germany; [Rehm, Jurgen] Sechenov First Moscow State Med Univ, Inst Leadership & Hlth Management, Dept Int Hlth Projects, Moscow, Russia",,"Rehm, J (corresponding author), Ctr Addict & Mental Hlth, Inst Mental Hlth Policy Res, Toronto, ON M5S 2S1, Canada.",jtrehm@gmail.com,,,"Swedish Research Council [2013-07434]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Institute of Neurosciences, Mental Health and Addiction (Canadian Research Initiative in Substance Misuse [CRISM]); Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Institute of Neurosciences, Mental Health and Addiction (Ontario Node grant) [SMN-13950]","Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission); Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Institute of Neurosciences, Mental Health and Addiction (Canadian Research Initiative in Substance Misuse [CRISM])(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Institute of Neurosciences, Mental Health and Addiction (Ontario Node grant)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR))","We thank Peter Anderson, Antoni Gual, Robin Room, Reinout Wiers and two other friendly reviewers who wish to remain anonymous.

Based on current trends, the UN Sustainable Development Goal to reduce premature mortality due to CVRDs by a third by 2030 will be challenging for many countries of low and middle income. We did systematic literature reviews of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness to identify priority interventions. We summarise the key findings and present a costed essential package of interventions to reduce risk of and manage CVRDs. On a population level, we recommend tobacco taxation, bans on trans fats, and compulsory reduction of salt in manufactured food products. We suggest primary health services be strengthened through the establishment of locally endorsed guidelines and ensured availability of essential medications. The policy interventions and health service delivery package we suggest could serve as the cornerstone for the management of CVRDs, and afford substantial financial risk protection for vulnerable households. We estimate that full implementation of the essential package would cost an additional US$21 per person in the average low-income country and $24 in the average lower-middle-income country. The essential package we describe could be a starting place for low-income and middle-income countries developing universal health coverage packages. Interventions could be rolled out as disease burden demands and budgets allow. Our outlined interventions provide a pathway for countries attempting to convert the UN Sustainable Development Goal commitments into tangible action.","[Prabhakaran, Dorairaj] Publ Hlth Fdn India, Gurgaon 122002, Haryana, India; [Prabhakaran, Dorairaj] Ctr Chron Dis Control, New Delhi, India; [Prabhakaran, Dorairaj] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Noncommunicable Dis Epidemiol, London, England; [Prabhakaran, Dorairaj] Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Anand, Shuchi] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Div Nephrol, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Watkins, David] Univ Washington, Dept Med, Seattle, WA USA; [Gaziano, Thomas] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Hlth Decis Sci, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Cardiovasc Med Div, Boston, MA USA; [Wu, Yangfeng] Peking Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, George Inst Global Hlth, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Mbanya, Jean Claude] Univ Yaounde I, Fac Med & Biomed Sci, Dept Internal Med & Specialties, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Nugent, Rachel] RTI Int, Seattle, WA USA",,"Prabhakaran, D (corresponding author), Publ Hlth Fdn India, Gurgaon 122002, Haryana, India.",dprabhakaran@ccdcindia.org,"Jabbour, Samer/Y-6860-2018; O'Donnell, Martin/ABE-7459-2020; Prabhakaran, Dorairaj/B-4147-2011; Marks, Guy B./F-5058-2013; Watkins, David/ABC-3783-2020; Lambert, Estelle/ABF-1268-2020; Mbanya, Jean Claude/T-5147-2018","Jabbour, Samer/0000-0002-7150-6856; O'Donnell, Martin/0000-0002-7347-7761; Prabhakaran, Dorairaj/0000-0002-3172-834X; Marks, Guy B./0000-0002-8976-8053; Watkins, David/0000-0001-6341-9595; Lambert, Estelle/0000-0003-4315-9153; Marin-Neto, Jose Antonio/0000-0002-8651-8833; Joshi, Rohina/0000-0002-3374-401X; Ali, Mohammed/0000-0001-7266-2503; Chandrasekar, Eeshwar/0000-0003-3494-8775; Mbanya, Jean Claude/0000-0001-9651-8653; Goenka, Shifalika/0000-0001-6993-2883; Kengne, Andre Pascal/0000-0002-5183-131X; Suhrcke, Marc/0000-0001-7263-8626; Naicker, Saraladevi/0000-0002-7058-9725; Fall, Caroline/0000-0003-4402-5552; Nugent, Rachel/0000-0001-6421-9077; Sedano-Chiroque, Franshesca L./0000-0001-5551-244X; Jeemon, Panniyammakal/0000-0003-4172-4307; Ajay, Vamadevan S/0000-0002-4102-0505; Feigin, Valery L./0000-0002-6372-1740; Miranda, J.

In this Series, the double burden of malnutrition (DBM) encompasses undernutrition in the form of stunting, and overweight and obesity. Health effects of the DBM include those associated with both undernutrition, such as impaired childhood development and greater susceptibility to infectious diseases, and overweight, especially in terms of increased risk of added visceral fat and increased risk of non-communicable diseases. These health effects have not been translated into economic costs for individuals and economies in the form of lost wages and productivity, as well as higher medical expenses. We summarise the existing approaches to modelling the economic effects of malnutrition and point out the weaknesses of these approaches for measuring economic losses from the DBM. Where population needs suggest that nutrition interventions take into account the DBM, economic evaluation can guide the choice of so-called double-duty interventions as an alternative to separate programming for stunting and overweight. We address the evidence gap with an economic analysis of the costs and benefits of an illustrative double-duty intervention that addresses both stunting and overweight in children aged 4 years and older by providing school meals with improved quality of diet. We assess the plausibility of our method and discuss how improved data and models can generate better estimates. Double-duty interventions could save money and be more efficient than single-duty interventions.","[Nugent, Rachel; Hale, Jessica; Hutchinson, Brian] RTI Int, Seattle, WA 98104 USA; [Nugent, Rachel; Levin, Carol] Univ Washington, Dept Global Hlth, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,"Nugent, R (corresponding author), RTI Int, Seattle, WA 98104 USA.",rnugent@rti.org,,"Nugent, Rachel/0000-0001-6421-9077",RTI International; WHO; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,RTI International; WHO(World Health Organization); Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),"Funding for work was provided through an internal research award from RTI International.

However, many patients either do not respond or do not have durable clinical benefit. Thus, there is great interest in developing predictors of response to immunotherapy and rational combination therapies that can enhance efficacy by overcoming primary and acquired resistance. In this Review, we provide an assessment of immunotherapy response biomarkers that can identify patients who will benefit from monotherapy rather than from combinations. We review the rationale for combination therapy and different strategies, including combinations with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, radiation therapy, intratumoural therapies, other immunomodulators, and adaptive cell therapy, including chimeric antigen T-cell receptors and other novel T-cell receptor-based therapies. There are many combination partners in development; therefore, a programmatic approach is needed to develop a framework for biomarker-driven combination therapy selection.","[Meric-Bernstam, Funda] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Invest Canc Therapeut, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Larkin, James] Royal Marsden NHS FoundationTrust, Canc Serv, London, England; [Tabernero, Josep] Vall dHebron Inst Oncol, Dept Med Oncol, Barcelona, Spain; [Bonini, Chiara] Univ Vita Salute San Raffaele, Expt Hematol Unit, Milan, Italy; [Bonini, Chiara] Ist Sci San Raffaele, Expt Hematol Unit, IRCCS Osped, Milan, Italy",,"Meric-Bernstam, F (corresponding author), Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Invest Canc Therapeut, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",fmeric@mdanderson.org,,,,,,,112,59,59,44,63,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,MAR 13,2021,397,10278,,,,,1010,1022,,10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32598-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32598-8,,MAR 2021,13,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,QV2NT,33285141,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000627814200029,View Full Record in Web of Science,6653,1,3,37,3,104,10,52,83,82,47,42,112,41,98,52,38

It is characterised by a chronic and destructive, small bile duct, granulomatous lymphocytic cholangitis, with typical seroreactivity for antimitochondrial antibodies. Patients have variable risks of progressive ductopenia, cholestasis, and biliary fibrosis. Considerations for the cause of this disease emphasise an interaction of chronic immune damage with biliary epithelial cell responses and encompass complex, poorly understood genetic risks and environmental triggers. Licensed disease-modifying treatment focuses on amelioration of cholestasis, with weight-dosed oral ursodeoxycholic acid. For patients who do not respond sufficiently, or patients with ursodeoxycholic acid intolerance, conditionally licensed add-on therapy is with the FXR (NR1H4) agonist, obeticholic acid. Off-label therapy is recognised as an alternative, notably with the pan-PPAR agonist bezafibrate; clinical trial agents are also under development. Baseline characteristics, such as young age, male sex, and advanced disease, and serum markers of liver injury, particularly bilirubin and ALP, are used to stratify risk and assess treatment responsiveness. Parallel attention to the burden of patient symptoms is paramount, including pruritus and fatigue.","[Lleo, Ana] Humanitas Univ, Dept Biomed Sci, Milan, Italy; [Lleo, Ana] Humanitas Clin & Res Ctr IRCCS, Div Internal Med & Hepatol, Dept Gastroenterol, Rozzano, Italy; [Wang, Giu-Qiang] Peking Univ First Hosp, Dept Infect Dis, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Giu-Qiang] Peking Univ First Hosp, Ctr Liver Dis, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Giu-Qiang] Peking Univ, Dept Infect Dis & Liver Dis, Int Hosp, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gershwin, Merrill Eric] Univ Calif Davis, Div Rheumatol Allergy & Clin Immunol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Hirschfield, Gideon M.] Univ Toronto, Toronto Ctr Liver Dis, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Toronto, ON M5G 2C4, Canada",,"Hirschfield, GM (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Toronto Ctr Liver Dis, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Toronto, ON M5G 2C4, Canada.",gideon.hirschfield@uhn.ca,,"LLEO, Ana/0000-0002-0561-7902",Lily and Terry Horner Chair in Autoimmune Liver Disease Research,Lily and Terry Horner Chair in Autoimmune Liver Disease Research,We acknowledge the ongoing support of patients with primary biliary cholangitis for the conduct of multiple observational and interventional studies that have informed the content of this Seminar.

Complicated community-acquired pneumonia should be suspected in any child with pneumonia not responding to appropriate antibiotic treatment within 48-72 h. Common causative organisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Patients have initial imaging with chest radiography and ultrasound, which can also be used to assess the lung parenchyma, to identify pleural fluid; CT scanning is not usually indicated. Complicated pneumonia is treated with a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics, and then oral antibiotics. The initial choice of antibiotic is guided by local microbiological knowledge and by subsequent positive cultures and molecular testing, including on pleural fluid if a drainage procedure is done. Information from pleural space imaging and drainage should guide the decision on whether to administer intrapleural fibrinolytics. Most patients are treated by drainage and more extensive surgery is rarely needed; in any event, in low-income and middle-income countries, resources for extensive surgeries are scarce. The clinical course of complicated community-acquired pneumonia can be prolonged, especially when patients have necrotising pneumonia, but complete recovery is the usual outcome.","[de Benedictis, Fernando M.] Salesi Childrens Hosp Fdn, Ancona, Italy; [Kerem, Eitan] Hadassah Hebrew Univ Hosp, Dept Pediat, Jerusalem, Israel; [Chang, Anne B.] Menzies Sch Hlth Res, Child Hlth Div, Darwin, NT, Australia; [Chang, Anne B.] Queensland Childrens Hosp, Dept Resp & Sleep Med, South Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Chang, Anne B.] Queensland Univ Technol, Ctr Healthcare Transformat, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Colin, Andrew A.] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Div Pediat Pulmonol, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Zar, Heather J.] Red Cross Childrens Hosp, Dept Paediat & Child Hlth, Cape Town, South Africa; [Zar, Heather J.] Univ Cape Town, MRC Unit Child & Adolescent Hlth, Cape Town, South Africa; [Bush, Andrew] Royal Brompton Hosp, Dept Paediat Resp Med, London SW3 6NP, England; [Bush, Andrew] Imperial Coll London, Imperial Sch Med, Natl Heart & Lung Inst, London, England",,"Bush, A (corresponding author), Royal Brompton Hosp, Dept Paediat Resp Med, London SW3 6NP, England.",a.bush@imperial.ac.uk,,"Mashiya, Nombeko Monica/0000-0003-0124-9118",,,,,184,31,32,2,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,SEP 12,2020,396,10253,,,,,786,798,,,,,,13,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,OA7BY,32919518,,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000577936900032,View Full Record in Web of Science,7153,1,77,139,43,6,84,13,168,43,170,156,175,154,43,38,59

This is likely due to the increased use of diagnostic imaging for purposes unrelated to the thyroid. Most thyroid nodules are benign, clinically insignificant, and safely managed with a surveillance program. The main goal of initial and long-term follow-up is identification of the small subgroup of nodules that harbor a clinically significant cancer (approximate to 10%), cause compressive symptoms (approximate to 5%), or progress to functional disease (approximate to 5%). OBSERVATIONS Thyroid function testing and ultrasonographic characteristics guide the initial management of thyroid nodules. Certain ultrasound features, such as a cystic or spongiform appearance, suggest a benign process that does not require additional testing. Suspicious sonographic patterns including solid composition, hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, and microcalcifications should prompt cytological evaluation. Additional diagnostic procedures, such as molecular testing, are indicated only in selected cases, such as indeterminate cytology (similar to 20%-30% of all biopsies). The initial risk estimate, derived from ultrasound and, if performed, cytology report, should determine the need for treatment and the type, frequency, and length of subsequent follow-up. Management includes simple observation, local treatments, and surgery and should be based on the estimated risk of malignancy and the presence and severity of compressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Most thyroid nodules are benign. A diagnostic approach that uses ultrasound and, when indicated, fine-needle aspiration biopsy and molecular testing, facilitates a personalized, risk-based protocol that promotes high-quality care and minimizes cost and unnecessary testing.","[Durante, Cosimo; Grani, Giorgio; Lamartina, Livia; Filetti, Sebastian] Univ Roma Sapienza, Dipartimento Med Interna & Specialita Med, Rome, Italy; [Mandel, Susan J.] Univ Penn, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Cooper, David S.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, Baltimore, MD USA",,"Cooper, DS (corresponding author), Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, 1830 E Monument St,Ste 333, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA.",dscooper@jhmi.edu,"Durante, Cosimo/E-4926-2014; Grani, Giorgio/D-7968-2011","Durante, Cosimo/0000-0002-1791-5915; Grani, Giorgio/0000-0002-0388-1283","University of Rome, Sapienza [C26V157CMC]; PhD program of Biotechnologies and Clinical Medicine of the University of Rome, Sapienza","University of Rome, Sapienza; PhD program of Biotechnologies and Clinical Medicine of the University of Rome, Sapienza","Drs Grani and Lamartina contributed to this article as recipients of the PhD program of Biotechnologies and Clinical Medicine of the University of Rome, Sapienza.

This review focuses on current approaches and evolving strategies for local and systemic therapy of breast cancer. OBSERVATIONS Breast cancer is categorized into 3 major subtypes based on the presence or absence of molecular markers for estrogen or progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor 2 (ERBB2; formerly HER2): hormone receptor positive/ERBB2 negative (70% of patients), ERBB2 positive (15%-20%), and triple-negative (tumors lacking all 3 standard molecular markers; 15%). More than 90% of breast cancers are not metastatic at the time of diagnosis. For people presenting without metastatic disease, therapeutic goals are tumor eradication and preventing recurrence. Triple-negative breast cancer is more likely to recur than the other 2 subtypes, with 85% 5-year breast cancer-specific survival for stage I triple-negative tumors vs 94% to 99% for hormone receptor positive and ERBB2 positive. Systemic therapy for nonmetastatic breast cancer is determined by subtype: patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors receive endocrine therapy, and a minority receive chemotherapy as well; patients with ERBB2-positive tumors receive ERBB2-targeted antibody or small-molecule inhibitor therapy combined with chemotherapy; and patients with triple-negative tumors receive chemotherapy alone. Local therapy for all patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer consists of surgical resection, with consideration of postoperative radiation if lumpectomy is performed. Increasingly, some systemic therapy is delivered before surgery. Tailoring postoperative treatment based on preoperative treatment response is under investigation. Metastatic breast cancer is treated according to subtype, with goals of prolonging life and palliating symptoms. Median overall survival for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer is approximately 1 year vs approximately 5 years for the other 2 subtypes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Breast cancer consists of 3 major tumor subtypes categorized according to estrogen or progesterone receptor expression and ERBB2 gene amplification. The 3 subtypes have distinct risk profiles and treatment strategies. Optimal therapy for each patient depends on tumor subtype, anatomic cancer stage, and patient preferences.","[Waks, Adrienne G.; Winer, Eric P.] Harvard Med Sch, Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA USA",,"Winer, EP (corresponding author), Dana Farber Canc Inst, 450 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",eric_winer@dfci.harvard.edu,,,,,,,104,1145,1167,146,719,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

OBSERVATIONS GERD can influence patients' health-related quality of life and is associated with an increased risk of esophagitis, esophageal strictures, Barrett esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Obesity, tobacco smoking, and genetic predisposition increase the risk of developing GERD. Typical GERD symptoms are often sufficient to determine the diagnosis, but less common symptoms and signs, such as dysphagia and chronic cough, may occur. Patients with typical GERD symptoms can be medicated empirically with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Among patients who do not respond to such treatment or if the diagnosis is unclear, endoscopy, esophageal manometry, and esophageal pH monitoring are recommended. Patients with GERD symptoms combined with warning symptoms of malignancy (eg, dysphagia, weight loss, bleeding) and those with other main risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma, such as older age, male sex, and obesity, should undergo endoscopy. Lifestyle changes, medication, and surgery are the main treatment options for GERD. Weight loss and smoking cessation are often useful. Medication with a PPI is the most common treatment, and after initial full-dose therapy, which usually is omeprazole 20 mg once daily, the aim is to use the lowest effective dose. Observational studies have suggested several adverse effects after long-term PPI, but these findings need to be confirmed before influencing clinical decision making. Surgery with laparoscopic fundoplication is an invasive treatment alternative in select patients after thorough and objective assessments, particularly if they are young and healthy. Endoscopic and less invasive surgical techniques are emerging, which may reduce the use of long-term PPI and fundoplication, but the long-term safety and efficacy remain to be scientifically established. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The clinical management of GERD influences the lives of many individuals and is responsible for substantial consumption of health care and societal resources. Treatments include lifestyle modification, PPI medication, and laparoscopic fundoplication. New endoscopic and less invasive surgical procedures are evolving. PPI use remains the dominant treatment, but long-term therapy requires follow-up and reevaluation for potential adverse effects.","[Maret-Ouda, John; Markar, Sheraz R.; Lagergren, Jesper] Karolinska Inst, Upper Gastrointestinal Surg, Dept Mol Med & Surg, Retzius St 13a, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Maret-Ouda, John; Markar, Sheraz R.; Lagergren, Jesper] Karolinska Univ Hosp, Stockholm, Sweden; [Maret-Ouda, John] Uppsala Univ, Ctr Clin Res Sormland, Eskilstuna, Sweden; [Markar, Sheraz R.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Surg & Canc, London, England; [Lagergren, Jesper] Kings Coll London, Sch Canc & Pharmaceut Sci, London, England",,"Lagergren, J (corresponding author), Karolinska Inst, Upper Gastrointestinal Surg, Dept Mol Med & Surg, Retzius St 13a, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.",jesper.lagergren@ki.se,,,Centre for Clinical Research Sormland; National Institute for Health Research; Distinguished Professor Award at Karolinska Institutet; United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Research Prize,Centre for Clinical Research Sormland; National Institute for Health Research(National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)); Distinguished Professor Award at Karolinska Institutet; United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Research Prize,Dr Maret-Ouda was supported by the Centre for Clinical Research Sormland.

Importance Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the US, and poor diet and lack of physical activity are major factors contributing to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Objective To review the benefits and harms of behavioral counseling interventions to improve diet and physical activity in adults with cardiovascular risk factors. Data Sources MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through September 2019; literature surveillance through July 24, 2020. Study Selection English-language randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of behavioral counseling interventions to help people with elevated blood pressure or lipid levels improve their diet and increase physical activity. Data Extraction and Synthesis Data were extracted from studies by one reviewer and checked by a second. Random-effects meta-analysis and qualitative synthesis were used. Main Outcomes and Measures Cardiovascular events, mortality, subjective well-being, cardiovascular risk factors, diet and physical activity measures (eg, minutes of physical activity, meeting physical activity recommendations), and harms. Interventions were categorized according to estimated contact time as low (<= 30 minutes), medium (31-360 minutes), and high (>360 minutes). Results Ninety-four RCTs were included (N = 52 174). Behavioral counseling interventions involved a median of 6 contact hours and 12 sessions over the course of 12 months and varied in format and dietary recommendations; only 5% addressed physical activity alone. Interventions were associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events (pooled relative risk, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.73-0.87]; 9 RCTs [n = 12 551]; I-2 = 0%). Event rates were variable; in the largest trial (Prevencion con Dieta Mediterranea [PREDIMED]), 3.6% in the intervention groups experienced a cardiovascular event, compared with 4.4% in the control group. Behavioral counseling interventions were associated with small, statistically significant reductions in continuous measures of blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, fasting glucose levels, and adiposity at 12 to 24 months' follow-up. Measurement of diet and physical activity was heterogeneous, and evidence suggested small improvements in diet consistent with the intervention recommendation targets but mixed findings and a more limited evidence base for physical activity. Adverse events were rare, with generally no group differences in serious adverse events, any adverse events, hospitalizations, musculoskeletal injuries, or withdrawals due to adverse events. Conclusions and Relevance Medium- and high-contact multisession behavioral counseling interventions to improve diet and increase physical activity for people with elevated blood pressure and lipid levels were effective in reducing cardiovascular events, blood pressure, low-density lipoproteins, and adiposity-related outcomes, with little to no risk of serious harm.","[O'Connor, Elizabeth A.; Evans, Corinne V.; Rushkin, Megan C.; Redmond, Nadia; Lin, Jennifer S.] Kaiser Permanente, Kaiser Permanente Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Ctr Hlth Res, Portland, OR USA",,"O'Connor, EA (corresponding author), Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Kaiser Permanente Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Ctr Hlth Res, 3800 N Interstate Ave, Portland, OR 97227 USA.",Elizabeth.O'Connor@kpchr.org,,,,,,,255,32,32,3,8,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Summaries of the expanding evidence for both the benefits and risks of bariatric surgery are needed to better guide shared decision-making conversations. OBSERVATIONS There are approximately 252 000 bariatric procedures (per 2018 numbers) performed each year in the US, of which an estimated 15% are revisions. The 1991 National Institutes of Health guidelines recommended consideration of bariatric surgery in patients with a body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 40 or higher or 35 or higher with serious obesity-related comorbidities. These guidelines are still widely used; however, there is increasing evidence that bariatric procedures should also be considered for patients with type 2 diabetes and a body mass index of 30 to 35 if hyperglycemia is inadequately controlled despite optimal medical treatment for type 2 diabetes. Substantial evidence indicates that surgery results in greater improvements in weight loss and type 2 diabetes outcomes, compared with nonsurgical interventions, regardless of the type of procedures used. The 2 most common procedures used currently, the sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass, have similar effects on weight loss and diabetes outcomes and similar safety through at least 5-year follow-up. However, emerging evidence suggests that the sleeve procedure is associated with fewer reoperations, and the bypass procedure may lead to more durable weight loss and glycemic control. Although safety is a concern, current data indicate that the perioperative mortality rates range from 0.03% to 0.2%, which has substantially improved since early 2000s. More long-term randomized studies are needed to assess the effect of bariatric procedures on cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other health outcomes and to evaluate emerging newer procedures. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Modern bariatric procedures have strong evidence of efficacy and safety. All patients with severe obesity-and especially those with type 2 diabetes-should be engaged in a shared decision-making conversation about the risks and benefits of surgery compared with continuing usual medical and lifestyle treatment, and the decision about surgery should be driven primarily by informed patient preferences.","[Arterburn, David E.] Kaiser Permanente, Washington Hlth Res Inst, 1730 Minor Ave,Ste 1600, Seattle, WA 98101 USA; [Telem, Dana A.] Univ Michigan, Dept Surg, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Kushner, Robert F.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Courcoulas, Anita P.] Univ Pittsburgh, Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Pittsburgh, PA USA",,"Arterburn, DE (corresponding author), Kaiser Permanente, Washington Hlth Res Inst, 1730 Minor Ave,Ste 1600, Seattle, WA 98101 USA.",david.e.arterburn@kp.org,,,National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [R01 DK115408],National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)),Drs Arterburn and Courcoulas were funded by a grant from the National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (R01 DK105960).

Data SourcesMEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials, from January 2002 through April 27, 2018; surveillance through March 22, 2019. Study SelectionStudies of adults with or without risk factors for pancreatic adenocarcinoma (eg, family history of pancreatic cancer, personal history of new-onset diabetes) undergoing imaging-based screening; studies of treatment for adults with screen-detected or asymptomatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Included study designs were randomized clinical trials, nonrandomized controlled intervention studies, diagnostic accuracy studies with a reference standard, cohort studies, and case-control studies (for evaluation of harms only). Studies consisting entirely of populations with known genetic syndromes associated with pancreatic cancer were excluded. Data Extraction and SynthesisTwo investigators independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles and rated included studies for quality; data were quantitatively analyzed to calculate a pooled diagnostic yield and narratively synthesized. Main Outcomes and MeasuresMortality, morbidity, or quality of life; diagnostic accuracy of screening tests; any harm of screening or treatment. ResultsThirteen fair-quality prospective cohort screening studies (N=1317) conducted predominantly in populations at high familial risk for pancreatic adenocarcinoma were included. No studies reported on the effect of screening on morbidity or mortality or on the effectiveness of treatment for screen-detected pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Although no studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of screening tests, all 13 studies reported the diagnostic yield. Yields ranged from 0 to 75 cases per 1000 persons in studies using endoscopic ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or computed tomography-based screening. In total, 18 cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma were detected in 1156 adults at increased familial risk and 0 cases were detected in 161 average-risk adults. In 8 studies (n=675) assessing procedural harms of screening, no serious harms from initial screening were reported. Two studies (n=271) found no evidence of psychosocial harms related to screening. Evidence of surgical harms was limited. Conclusions and RelevanceImaging-based screening in groups at high familial risk can detect pancreatic adenocarcinoma with limited evidence of minimal harms. However, the effect of screening on morbidity and mortality in groups at high familial risk has not been studied, and no data are available in average-risk populations. There is limited evidence to assess benefits or harms of surgical intervention for screen-detected pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","[Henrikson, Nora B.; Bowles, Erin J.

In 2020, an estimated 228820 persons were diagnosed with lung cancer, and 135720 persons died of the disease. The most important risk factor for lung cancer is smoking. Increasing age is also a risk factor for lung cancer. Lung cancer has a generally poor prognosis, with an overall 5-year survival rate of 20.5%. However, early-stage lung cancer has a better prognosis and is more amenable to treatment. ObjectiveTo update its 2013 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on the accuracy of screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and on the benefits and harms of screening for lung cancer and commissioned a collaborative modeling study to provide information about the optimum age at which to begin and end screening, the optimal screening interval, and the relative benefits and harms of different screening strategies compared with modified versions of multivariate risk prediction models. PopulationThis recommendation statement applies to adults aged 50 to 80 years who have a 20 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Evidence AssessmentThe USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT has a moderate net benefit in persons at high risk of lung cancer based on age, total cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke, and years since quitting smoking. RecommendationThe USPSTF recommends annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT in adults aged 50 to 80 years who have a 20 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Screening should be discontinued once a person has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy or the ability or willingness to have curative lung surgery. (B recommendation) This recommendation replaces the 2013 USPSTF statement that recommended annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT in adults aged 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. This US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement concludes with moderate certainty that annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography has a moderate benefit in persons at high risk of lung cancer based on age, total cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke, and years since quitting smoking (Grade B).","[Krist, Alex H.] Fairfax Family Practice Residency, Fairfax, VA USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, 830 E Main St,One Capitol Sq,Sixth Floor, Richmond, VA 23219 USA; [Davidson, Karina W.] Northwell Hlth, Feinstein Inst Med Res, Manhasset, NY USA; [Mangione, Carol M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Barry, Michael J.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Cabana, Michael] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Caughey, Aaron B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Davis, Esa M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Donahue, Katrina E.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Doubeni, Chyke A.] Mayo Clin, Rochester, MN USA; [Kubik, Martha] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Landefeld, C.

Findings In this meta-analysis that included 51085 patients with COPD and hypercapnia, home use of bilevel positive airway pressure, compared with no device, was significantly associated with lower risk of mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.66), fewer patients with hospital admissions (OR, 0.22), and lower need for intubation (OR, 0.34), but no significant difference in quality of life. Noninvasive home mechanical ventilator, compared with no device, was significantly associated with lower risk of hospital admission (rate ratio, 0.50), but there was no significant difference in mortality risk. However, the evidence was low to moderate in quality. Meaning Among patients with COPD and hypercapnia, home NIPPV, compared with no device use, was significantly associated with better clinical outcomes and no significant difference in quality of life. However, the evidence was low to moderate in quality, the evidence on quality of life was insufficient, and the analyses for some outcomes were based on small numbers of studies. This meta-analysis of trials and observational studies evaluates the association of the use of home noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) via home mechanical ventilator (HMV) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) devices with clinical outcomes and adverse events in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypercapnia. Importance The association of home noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) with outcomes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypercapnia is uncertain. Objective To evaluate the association of home NIPPV via bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) devices and noninvasive home mechanical ventilator (HMV) devices with clinical outcomes and adverse events in patients with COPD and hypercapnia. Data Sources Search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Cochrane Central Registrar of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, National Guideline Clearinghouse, and Scopus for English-language articles published from January 1, 1995, to November 6, 2019. Study Selection Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and comparative observational studies that enrolled adults with COPD with hypercapnia who used home NIPPV for more than 1 month were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis Data extraction was completed by independent pairs of reviewers. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool for RCTs and select items from the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for nonrandomized studies. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcomes were mortality, all-cause hospital admissions, need for intubation, and quality of life at the longest follow-up. Results A total of 21 RCTs and 12 observational studies evaluating 51085 patients (mean [SD] age, 65.7 [2.1] years; 43% women) were included, among whom there were 434 deaths and 27 patients who underwent intubation. BPAP compared with no device was significantly associated with lower risk of mortality (22.31% vs 28.57%; risk difference [RD], -5.53% [95% CI, -10.29% to -0.76%]; odds ratio [OR], 0.66 [95% CI, 0.51-0.87]; P = .003; 13 studies; 1423 patients; strength of evidence [SOE], moderate), fewer patients with all-cause hospital admissions (39.74% vs 75.00%; RD, -35.26% [95% CI, -49.39% to -21.12%]; OR, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.11-0.43]; P < .001; 1 study; 166 patients; SOE, low), and lower need for intubation (5.34% vs 14.71%; RD, -8.02% [95% CI, -14.77% to -1.28%]; OR, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.14-0.83]; P = .02; 3 studies; 267 patients; SOE, moderate). There was no significant difference in the total number of all-cause hospital admissions (rate ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.71-1.17]; P = .47; 5 studies; 326 patients; SOE, low) or quality of life (standardized mean difference, 0.16 [95% CI, -0.06 to 0.39]; P = .15; 9 studies; 833 patients; SOE, insufficient). Noninvasive HMV use compared with no device was significantly associated with fewer all-cause hospital admissions (rate ratio, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.35-0.71]; P < .001; 1 study; 93 patients; SOE, low), but not mortality (21.84% vs 34.09%; RD, -11.99% [95% CI, -24.77% to 0.79%]; OR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.29-1.08]; P = .49; 2 studies; 175 patients; SOE, insufficient). There was no statistically significant difference in the total number of adverse events in patients using NIPPV compared with no device (0.18 vs 0.17 per patient; P = .84; 6 studies; 414 patients). Conclusions and Relevance In this meta-analysis of patients with COPD and hypercapnia, home BPAP, compared with no device, was associated with lower risk of mortality, all-cause hospital admission, and intubation, but no significant difference in quality of life. Noninvasive HMV, compared with no device, was significantly associated with lower risk of hospital admission, but there was no significant difference in mortality risk. However, the evidence was low to moderate in quality, the evidence on quality of life was insufficient, and the analyses for some outcomes were based on small numbers of studies.","[Wilson, Michael E.; Dobler, Claudia C.; Morrow, Allison S.; Beuschel, Bradley; Alsawas, Mouaz; Benkhadra, Raed; Seisa, Mohamed; Mittal, Aniket; Sanchez, Manuel; Daraz, Lubna; Murad, M.

In 2014, it was estimated that 480000 deaths annually are attributed to cigarette smoking, including second hand smoke exposure. Smoking during pregnancy can increase the risk of numerous adverse pregnancy outcomes (eg, miscarriage and congenital anomalies) and complications in the offspring (including sudden infant death syndrome and impaired lung function in childhood). In 2019, an estimated 50.6 million US adults (20.8% of the adult population) used tobacco; 14.0% of the US adult population currently smoked cigarettes and 4.5% of the adult population used electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). Among pregnant US women who gave birth in 2016, 7.2% reported smoking cigarettes while pregnant. ObjectiveTo update its 2015 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review to evaluate the benefits and harms of primary care interventions on tobacco use cessation in adults, including pregnant persons. PopulationThis recommendation statement applies to adults 18 years or older, including pregnant persons. Evidence AssessmentThe USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of behavioral interventions and US Food and Drug Associated (FDA)-approved pharmacotherapy for tobacco smoking cessation, alone or combined, in nonpregnant adults who smoke is substantial. The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of behavioral interventions for tobacco smoking cessation on perinatal outcomes and smoking cessation in pregnant persons is substantial. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on pharmacotherapy interventions for tobacco smoking cessation in pregnant persons is insufficient because few studies are available, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on the use of e-cigarettes for tobacco smoking cessation in adults, including pregnant persons, is insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. The USPSTF has identified the lack of well-designed, randomized clinical trials on e-cigarettes that report smoking abstinence or adverse events as a critical gap in the evidence. RecommendationsThe USPSTF recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to nonpregnant adults who use tobacco. (A recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation to pregnant persons who use tobacco. (A recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy interventions for tobacco cessation in pregnant persons. (I statement) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of e-cigarettes for tobacco cessation in adults, including pregnant persons. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians direct patients who use tobacco to other tobacco cessation interventions with proven effectiveness and established safety. (I statement) This 2021 US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions and pharmacotherapy for cessation (A recommendation) and concludes that evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of tobacco cessation pharmacotherapy in pregnant persons and e- cigarettes for tobacco cessation in any adult (I statement).","[Krist, Alex H.] Fairfax Family Practice Residency, Fairfax, VA USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, One Capitol Sq,Sixth Floor,830 E Main St, Richmond, VA 23219 USA; [Davidson, Karina W.] Feinstein Inst Med Res Northwell Hlth, Manhasset, NY USA; [Mangione, Carol M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Barry, Michael J.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Cabana, Michael] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Caughey, Aaron B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Donahue, Katrina] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Doubeni, Chyke A.] Mayo Clin, Rochester, MN USA; [Epling, John W., Jr.] Virginia Tech Caril Sch Med, Roanoke, VA USA; [Kubik, Martha] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Ogedegbe, Gbenga] NYU, New York, NY USA; [Pbert, Lori] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Worcester, MA USA; [Silverstein, Michael] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Simon, Melissa A.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Univ Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Pacific Hlth Res & Educ Inst, Honolulu, HI USA; [Wong, John B.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02111 USA",,"Krist, AH (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, One Capitol Sq,Sixth Floor,830 E Main St, Richmond, VA 23219 USA.",chair@uspstf.ne,,"Epling, John W/0000-0001-9445-8669",,,,,102,60,60,6,17,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

OBJECTIVE To formulate a consensus statement of recommendations on determination of BD/DNC based on review of the literature and expert opinion of a large multidisciplinary, international panel. PROCESS Relevant international professional societies were recruited to develop recommendations regarding determination of BD/DNC. Literature searches of the Cochrane, Embase, and MEDLINE databases included January 1,1992, through April 2020 identified pertinent articles for review. Because of the lack of high-quality data from randomized clinical trials or large observational studies, recommendations were formulated based on consensus of contributors and medical societies that represented relevant disciplines, including critical care, neurology, and neurosurgery. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Based on review of the literature and consensus from a large multidisciplinary, international panel, minimum clinical criteria needed to determine BD/DNC in various circumstances were developed. RECOMMENDATIONS Prior to evaluating a patient for BD/DNC, the patient should have an established neurologic diagnosis that can lead to the complete and irreversible loss of all brain function, and conditions that may confound the clinical examination and diseases that may mimic BD/DNC should be excluded. Determination of BD/DNC can be done with a clinical examination that demonstrates coma, brainstem areflexia, and apnea. This is seen when (1) there is no evidence of arousal or awareness to maximal external stimulation, including noxious visual, auditory, and tactile stimulation; (2) pupils are fixed in a midsize or dilated position and are nonreactive to light; (3) corneal, oculocephalic, and oculovestibular reflexes are absent; (4) there is no facial movement to noxious stimulation; (5) the gag reflex is absent to bilateral posterior pharyngeal stimulation; (6) the cough reflex is absent to deep tracheal suctioning; (7) there is no brain-mediated motor response to noxious stimulation of the limbs; and (8) spontaneous respirations are not observed when apnea test targets reach pH <7.30 and PaCO2 >= 60 mm Hg. If the clinical examination cannot be completed, ancillary testing may be considered with blood flow studies or electrophysiologic testing. Special consideration is needed for children, for persons receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and for those receiving therapeutic hypothermia, as well as for factors such as religious, societal, and cultural perspectives; legal requirements; and resource availability. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This report provides recommendations for the minimum clinical standards for determination of brain death/death by neurologic criteria in adults and children with clear guidance for various clinical circumstances. The recommendations have widespread international society endorsement and can serve to guide professional societies and countries in the revision or development of protocols and procedures for determination of brain death/death by neurologic criteria, leading to greater consistency within and between countries.","[Greer, David M.] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Shemie, Sam D.] McGill Univ, Montreal Childrens Hosp, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Shemie, Sam D.; Torrance, Sylvia; Dawson, Rosanne] Canadian Blood Serv, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Lewis, Ariane] NYU Langone Med Ctr, New York, NY USA; [Varelas, Panayiotis] Albany Med Coll, Albany, NY 12208 USA; [Goldenberg, Fernando D.] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Bernat, James L.] Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Hanover, NH USA; [Souter, Michael] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Topcuoglu, Mehmet Akif] Hacettepe Univ, Dept Neurol, Ankara, Turkey; [Alexandrov, Anne W.] Univ Tennessee, Ctr Hlth Sci, Coll Nursing, Memphis, TN 38163 USA; [Baldisseri, Marie] Univ Pittsburgh, Med Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Bleck, Thomas] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Citerio, Giuseppe] Univ Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy; [Hoppe, Arnold] Univ Desarrollo, Clin Alemana, Santiago, Chile; [Jacobe, Stephen] Univ Sydney, Westmead, NSW, Australia; [Jacobe, Stephen] Childrens Hosp Westmead, Westmead, NSW, Australia; [Manara, Alex] Southmead Hosp, Bristol, Avon, England; [Nakagawa, Thomas A.] Univ Florida, Jacksonville, FL USA; [Pope, Thaddeus Mason] Mitchell Hamline Sch Law, St Paul, MN USA; [Silvester, William] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Thomson, David] Univ Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa; [Al Rahma, Hussain] Dubai Hosp, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Badenes, Rafael] Univ Valencia, Hosp Clin Univ, Valencia, Spain; [Baker, Andrew J.] St Michaels Hosp, Unity Hlth Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Baker, Andrew J.; Quayyum, Sarah] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Cerny, Vladimir] Univ JE Purkyne, Masaryk Hosp, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic; [Chang, Cherylee] Queens Med Ctr, Honolulu, HI USA; [Chang, Tiffany R.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Gnedovskaya, Elena; Piradov, Michael] Res Ctr Neurol, Moscow, Russia; [Han, Moon-Ku] Seoul Natl Univ, Bundang Hosp, Seoul, South Korea; [Honeybul, Stephen] Sir Charles Gairdner Hosp, Nedlands, WA, Australia; [Jimenez, Edgar] Texas A&M, College Stn, TX USA; [Kuroda, Yasuhiro] Kagawa Univ, Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan; [Liu, Gang; Su, Ying-ying] Capital Med Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Mallick, Uzzwal Kumar] Natl Inst Neurosci & Hosp, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Marquevich, Victoria] Hosp Univ Austral, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Mejia-Mantilla, Jorge] Fdn Valle Lili, Cali, Colombia; [Shrestha, Gentle Sunder] Tribhuvan Univ Teaching Hosp, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Timmons, Shelly D.] Indiana Univ, Indianapolis, IN 46204 USA; [Teitelbaum, Jeanne] Montreal Neurol Inst, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Videtta, Walter] Natl Hosp, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Zirpe, Kapil] Ruby Hall Clin, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Sung, Gene] Univ Southern Calif, 2051 Marengo St,IPT A4E111, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA",,"Sung, GN (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, 2051 Marengo St,IPT A4E111, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA.",gsung@usc.edu,"Chang, Cherylee/ABG-2080-2020; Topcuoglu, Mehmet A./ABE-2655-2021; Thomson, David/AAQ-9471-2021","Thomson, David/0000-0003-2433-3611; Lewis, Ariane/0000-0002-0756-7320; Badenes, Rafael/0000-0001-7017-0150; HOPPE, ARNOLD/0000-0002-4236-0173; Goldenberg, Fernando/0000-0003-1100-6830",,,,,142,80,84,5,25,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

OBJECTIVE To compare potential drivers of spending, such as structural capacity and utilization, in the United States with those of 10 of the highest-income countries (United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Australia, Japan, Sweden, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Denmark) to gain insight into what the United States can learn from these nations. EVIDENCE Analysis of data primarily from 2013-2016 from key international organizations including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), comparing underlying differences in structural features, types of health care and social spending, and performance between the United States and 10 high-income countries. When data were not available for a given country or more accurate country-level estimates were available from sources other than the OECD, country-specific data sources were used. FINDINGS In 2016, the US spent 17.8% of its gross domestic product on health care, and spending in the other countries ranged from 9.6%(Australia) to 12.4%(Switzerland). The proportion of the population with health insurance was 90% in the US, lower than the other countries (range, 99%-100%), and the US had the highest proportion of private health insurance (55.3%). For some determinants of health such as smoking, the US ranked second lowest of the countries (11.4% of the US population >= 15 years smokes daily; mean of all 11 countries, 16.6%), but the US had the highest percentage of adults who were overweight or obese at 70.1%(range for other countries, 23.8%-63.4%; mean of all 11 countries, 55.6%). Life expectancy in the US was the lowest of the 11 countries at 78.8 years (range for other countries, 80.7-83.9 years; mean of all 11 countries, 81.7 years), and infant mortality was the highest (5.8 deaths per 1000 live births in the US; 3.6 per 1000 for all 11 countries). The US did not differ substantially from the other countries in physician workforce (2.6 physicians per 1000; 43% primary care physicians), or nursing workforce (11.1 nurses per 1000). The US had comparable numbers of hospital beds (2.8 per 1000) but higher utilization of magnetic resonance imaging (118 per 1000) and computed tomography (245 per 1000) vs other countries. The US had similar rates of utilization (US discharges per 100 000 were 192 for acute myocardial infarction, 365 for pneumonia, 230 for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; procedures per 100 000 were 204 for hip replacement, 226 for knee replacement, and 79 for coronary artery bypass graft surgery). Administrative costs of care (activities relating to planning, regulating, and managing health systems and services) accounted for 8% in the US vs a range of 1% to 3% in the other countries. For pharmaceutical costs, spending per capita was $1443 in the US vs a range of $466 to $939 in other countries. Salaries of physicians and nurses were higher in the US; for example, generalist physicians salaries were $218 173 in the US compared with a range of $86 607 to $154 126 in the other countries. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The United States spent approximately twice as much as other high-income countries on medical care, yet utilization rates in the United States were largely similar to those in other nations. Prices of labor and goods, including pharmaceuticals, and administrative costs appeared to be the major drivers of the difference in overall cost between the United States and other high-income countries. As patients, physicians, policy makers, and legislators actively debate the future of the US health system, data such as these are needed to inform policy decisions.","[Papanicolas, Irene; Woskie, Liana R.; Jha, Ashish K.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Boston, MA USA; [Papanicolas, Irene; Woskie, Liana R.; Jha, Ashish K.] Harvard Global Hlth Inst, Cambridge, MA USA; [Papanicolas, Irene; Woskie, Liana R.] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Hlth Policy, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",,"Papanicolas, I (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Hlth Policy, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",i.n.papanicolas@lse.ac.uk,,"Woskie, Liana/0000-0002-7451-6849",,,,,34,643,646,28,289,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Importance The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in the United States is between 7% and 16%, most common in women and young people, with annual direct costs estimated at more than $1 billion dollars in the United States. Traditionally, the diagnosis of IBS has been based on the positive identification of symptoms that correlate with several different syndromes associated with disorders such as IBS diarrhea, IBS constipation, functional diarrhea, functional constipation, chronic functional abdominal pain, or bloating. Several peripheral and central mechanisms initiate gastrointestinal motor and sensory dysfunctions leading to IBS symptoms. Those dysfunctions may require evaluation in patients whose symptoms do not respond to first-line treatments. Observations Validation studies of consensus symptom-based criteria have identified deficiencies that favor a simpler identification of the predominant symptoms of abdominal pain, bowel dysfunction, and bloating and exclusion of alarm symptoms such as unintentional weight loss, rectal bleeding, or recent change in bowel function. Symptom-based diagnosis of IBS is enhanced with additional history for symptoms of somatoform and psychological disorders and alarm symptoms, physical examination including digital rectal examination, and screening tests to exclude organic disease (by measuring hemoglobin and C-reactive protein concentrations). The initial treatment plan should include patient education, reassurance, and first-line treatments such as fiber and osmotic laxatives for constipation, opioids for diarrhea, antispasmodics for pain and for management of associated psychological disorders. For patients who do not respond to those IBS treatments, testing for specific functional disorders may be required in a minority of patients with IBS. These disorders include rectal evacuation disorder, abnormal colonic transit, and bile acid diarrhea. Their identification is followed by individualized treatment, such as pelvic floor retraining for rectal evacuation disorders, sequestrants for bile acid diarrhea, and secretory agents for constipation, although there is only limited evidence that this individualized management approach is effective. Conclusions and Relevance Advances in the identification of specific dysfunctions as causes of individual symptoms in the IBS spectrum leads to the potential to enhance the diagnosis and management of symptoms for the majority of patients for whom first-line therapies of IBS and management of comorbid psychological disorders are insufficient.","[Camilleri, Michael] Mayo Clin, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Clin Enter Neurosci Translat & Epidemiol Res CENT, Rochester, MN USA",,"Camilleri, M (corresponding author), Mayo Clin, 200 First St SW,Charlton Bldg,Room 8-110, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.",camilleri.michael@mayo.edu,,,,,,,112,24,28,6,19,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

We aimed to review and synthesise available mortality data on international migrants. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases for observational studies, systematic reviews, and randomised controlled trials published between Jan 1, 2001, and March 31, 2017, without language restrictions. We included studies reporting mortality outcomes for international migrants of any age residing outside their country of birth. Studies that recruited participants exclusively from intensive care or high dependency hospital units, with an existing health condition or status, or a particular health exposure were excluded. We also excluded studies limited to maternal or perinatal outcomes. We screened studies using systematic review software and extracted data from published reports. The main outcomes were all-cause and International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10) cause-specific standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and absolute mortality rates. We calculated summary estimates using randomeffects models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017073608. Findings Of the 12 480 articles identified by our search, 96 studies were eligible for inclusion. The studies were geographically diverse and included data from all global regions and for 92 countries. 5464 mortality estimates for more than 15.2 million migrants were included, of which 5327 (97%) were from high-income countries, 115 (2%) were from middle-income countries, and 22 (< 1%) were from low-income countries. Few studies included mortality estimates for refugees (110 estimates), asylum seekers (144 estimates), or labour migrants (six estimates). The summary estimate of all-cause SMR for international migrants was lower than one when compared with the general population in destination countries (0.70 [95% CI 0.65-0.76]; I-2 = 99.8%). All-cause SMR was lower in both male migrants (0.72 [0.63-0.81]; I-2 = 99.8%) and female migrants (0.75 [0.67-0.84]; I-2 = 99.8%) compared with the general population. A mortality advantage was evident for refugees (SMR 0.50 [0.46-0.54]; I-2 = 89.8%), but not for asylum seekers (1.05 [0.89-1.24]; I-2 = 54.4%), although limited data was available on these groups. SMRs for all causes of death were lower in migrants compared with the general populations in the destination country across all 13 ICD-10 categories analysed, with the exception of infectious diseases and external causes. Heterogeneity was high across the majority of analyses. Point estimates of all-cause age-standardised mortality in migrants ranged from 420 to 874 per 100 000 population. Interpretation Our study showed that international migrants have a mortality advantage compared with general populations, and that this advantage persisted across the majority of ICD-10 disease categories. The mortality advantage identified will be representative of international migrants in high-income countries who are studying, working, or have joined family members in these countries. However, our results might not reflect the health outcomes of more marginalised groups in low-income and middle-income countries because little data were available for these groups, highlighting an important gap in existing research. Our results present an opportunity to reframe the public discourse on international migration and health in high-income countries. Copyright (c) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The 2009 National Academy of Medicine (NAM; formerly the Institute of Medicine) recommendations for healthy GWG vary according to prepregnancy weight category. ObjectiveTo review and synthesize the evidence on benefits and harms of behavioral interventions to promote healthy weight gain during pregnancy to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation. Data SourcesOvid MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library to March 2020, with surveillance through February 2021. Study SelectionRandomized clinical trials and nonrandomized controlled intervention studies focused on diet, exercise, and/or behavioral counseling interventions on GWG. Data Extraction and SynthesisIndependent data abstraction and study quality rating with dual review. Main Outcomes and MeasuresGestational weight-related outcomes; maternal and infant morbidity and mortality; harms. ResultsSixty-eight studies (N=25789) were included. Sixty-seven studies evaluated interventions during pregnancy, and 1 evaluated an intervention prior to pregnancy. GWG interventions were associated with reductions in risk of gestational diabetes (43 trials, n=19752; relative risk [RR], 0.87 [95% CI, 0.79 to 0.95]; absolute risk difference [ARD], -1.6%) and emergency cesarean delivery (14 trials, n=7520; RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.74 to 0.96]; ARD, -2.4%). There was no significant association between GWG interventions and risk of gestational hypertension, cesarean delivery, or preeclampsia. GWG interventions were associated with decreased risk of macrosomia (25 trials, n=13990; RR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.65 to 0.92]; ARD, -1.9%) and large for gestational age (26 trials, n=13000; RR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.80 to 0.99]; ARD, -1.3%) but were not associated with preterm birth. Intervention participants experienced reduced weight gain across all prepregnancy weight categories (55 trials, n=20090; pooled mean difference, -1.02 kg [95% CI, -1.30 to -0.75]) and demonstrated lower likelihood of GWG in excess of NAM recommendations (39 trials, n=14271; RR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.77 to 0.89]; ARD, -7.6%). GWG interventions were associated with reduced postpartum weight retention at 12 months (10 trials, n=3957; mean difference, -0.63 kg [95% CI, -1.44 to -0.01]). Data on harms were limited. Conclusions and RelevanceCounseling and active behavioral interventions to limit GWG were associated with decreased risk of gestational diabetes, emergency cesarean delivery, macrosomia, and large for gestational age. GWG interventions were also associated with modest reductions in mean GWG and decreased likelihood of exceeding NAM recommendations for GWG. This systematic review to support the 2021 US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement on interventions for healthy weight and weight gain in pregnancy summarizes published evidence on the benefits and harms of counseling and behavioral interventions for healthy weight and gestational weight gain in adolescent and adult women who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy.","[Cantor, Amy G.; Jungbauer, Rebecca M.; McDonagh, Marian; Blazina, Ian; Weeks, Chandler; Fu, Rongwei; Chou, Roger] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Pacific Northwest Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Dept Med Informat & Clin Epidemiol, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Cantor, Amy G.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Family Med, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Cantor, Amy G.; Marshall, Nicole E.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Fu, Rongwei] Portland State Univ, Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [LeBlanc, Erin S.] Kaiser Permanente, Ctr Hlth Res, Portland, OR USA",,"Cantor, AG (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",cantor@ohsu.edu,,"Cantor, Amy/0000-0002-4467-8484",,,,,113,17,17,1,5,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Blood pressure support with a noncatecholamine vasopressor may reduce stimulation of adrenergic receptors and decrease myocardial oxygen demand. Atrial fibrillation is common with catecholamines and is associated with adverse events, including mortality and increased length of stay (LOS). OBJECTIVES To determine whether treatment with vasopressin + catecholamine vasopressors compared with catecholamine vasopressors alone was associated with reductions in the risk of adverse events. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched from inception to February 2018. Experts were asked and meta-registries searched to identify ongoing trials. STUDY SELECTION Pairs of reviewers identified randomized clinical trials comparing vasopressin in combination with catecholamine vasopressors to catecholamines alone for patients with distributive shock. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers abstracted data independently. A random-effects model was used to combine data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was atrial fibrillation. Other outcomes included mortality, requirement for renal replacement therapy (RRT), myocardial injury, ventricular arrhythmia, stroke, and LOS in the intensive care unit and hospital. Measures of association are reported as risk ratios (RRs) for clinical outcomes and mean differences for LOS. RESULTS Twenty-three randomized clinical trials were identified (3088 patients; mean age, 61.1 years [14.2]; women, 45.3%). High-quality evidence supported a lower risk of atrial fibrillation associated with vasopressin treatment (RR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.67 to 0.88]; risk difference [RD], -0.06 [95% CI, -0.13 to 0.01]). For mortality, the overall RR estimate was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.82 to 0.97; RD, -0.04 [95% CI, -0.07 to 0.00]); however, when limited to trials at low risk of bias, the RR estimate was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.84 to 1.11). The overall RR estimate for RRT was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.51 to 1.08; RD, -0.07 [95% CI, -0.12 to -0.01]). However, in an analysis limited to trials at low risk of bias, RR was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.92, P for interaction =.77). There were no significant differences in the pooled risks for other outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the addition of vasopressin to catecholamine vasopressors compared with catecholamines alone was associated with a lower risk of atrial fibrillation. Findings for secondary outcomes varied.","[McIntyre, William F.; Um, Kevin J.; Alhazzani, Waleed; Lengyel, Alexandra P.; Healey, Jeff S.; Whitlock, Richard P.; Belley-Cote, Emilie P.] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Hajjar, Ludhmila] Univ Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Gordon, Anthony C.] Charing Cross Hosp, London, England; [Gordon, Anthony C.] Imperial Coll London, London, England; [Lamontagne, Francois] Univ Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada",,"Belley-Cote, EP (corresponding author), David Braley Cardiac Vasc & Stroke Res Inst, 237 Barton St E,Room 1C1-5B, Hamilton, ON L8L 2X2, Canada.",emilie.belley-cote@phri.ca,"Gordon, Anthony/A-3472-2012; Whitlock, Richard/AAQ-1593-2021","Gordon, Anthony/0000-0002-0419-547X; Whitlock, Richard/0000-0002-6863-5884; Abrahao Hajjar, Ludhmila/0000-0001-5645-2055; McIntyre, William F/0000-0001-6082-7542",Canadian Stroke Prevention Intervention Network; National Institute for Health Research; Tenax Therapeutics; Orion Pharma; Ferring Pharmaceuticals; GlaxoSmithKline; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Amomed Pharma; Medtronic; Bristol-Meyers Squibb/Pfizer; Canadian Institutes of Health Research,Canadian Stroke Prevention Intervention Network; National Institute for Health Research(National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)); Tenax Therapeutics; Orion Pharma; Ferring Pharmaceuticals(Ferring Pharmaceuticals); GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline); Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb); Amomed Pharma(Dexcel Pharma); Medtronic(Medtronic); Bristol-Meyers Squibb/Pfizer; Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),"All authors have completed and submitted the ICMJE Form for Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest.

Significant progress has been made over the past 2 decades regarding understanding of disease pathophysiology, optimal outcome measures, and effective treatment strategies, including the recognition of the importance of diagnosing and treating RA early. OBSERVATIONS Early diagnosis and treatment of RA can avert or substantially slow progression of joint damage in up to 90% of patients, thereby preventing irreversible disability. The development of novel instruments to measure disease activity and identify the presence or absence of remission have facilitated new treatment strategies to arrest RA before joints are damaged irreversibly. Outcomes have been improved by recognizing the benefits of early diagnosis and early therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The treatment target is remission or a state of at least low disease activity, which should be attained within 6 months. Methotrexate is first-line therapy and should be prescribed at an optimal dose of 25mg weekly and in combination with glucocorticoids; 40% to 50% of patients reach remission or at least low disease activity with this regimen. If this treatment fails, sequential application of targeted therapies, such as biologic agents (eg, tumor necrosis factor [TNF] inhibitors) or Janus kinase inhibitors in combination with methotrexate, have allowed up to 75% of these patients to reach the treatment target over time. New therapies have been developed in response to new pathogenetic findings. The costs of some therapies are considerable, but these costs are decreasing with the advent of biosimilar drugs (drugs essentially identical to the original biologic drugs but usually available at lower cost). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Scientific advances have improved therapies that prevent progression of irreversible joint damage in up to 90% of patients with RA. Early treatment with methotrexate plus glucocorticoids and subsequently with other DMARDs, such as inhibitors of TNF, IL-6, or Janus kinases, improves outcomes and prevents RA-related disability. A treat-to-target strategy aimed at reducing disease activity by at least 50% within 3 months and achieving remission or low disease activity within 6 months, with sequential drug treatment if needed, can prevent RA-related disability.","[Aletaha, Daniel; Smolen, Josef S.] Med Univ Vienna, Div Rheumatol, Dept Med 3, Spitalgasse 23, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",,"Aletaha, D (corresponding author), Med Univ Vienna, Div Rheumatol, Dept Med 3, Spitalgasse 23, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",daniel.aletaha@meduniwien.ac.at,,,Merck Sharp Dohme; Bristol-Myers Squibb; AbbVie; AstraZeneca; Janssen; Lilly; Merck Sharpe Dohme; Pfizer; Roche,Merck Sharp Dohme(Merck & Company); Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb); AbbVie(AbbVie); AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca); Janssen(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc); Lilly(Eli Lilly); Merck Sharpe Dohme(Merck & Company); Pfizer(Pfizer); Roche(Roche Holding),"The authors have completed and submitted the ICMJE Form for Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest.

ObjectiveTo update the 2014 USPSTF review on screening for chlamydial and gonococcal infection in adults and adolescents, including those who are pregnant. Data SourcesCochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Ovid MEDLINE (January 1, 2014, through May 28, 2020) with surveillance through May 21, 2021. Study SelectionRandomized clinical trials and observational studies of screening effectiveness, accuracy of risk stratification and alternative screening methods, accuracy of tests, and screening harms. Data Extraction and SynthesisOne investigator abstracted data; a second checked accuracy. Two investigators independently assessed study quality. Main Outcomes and MeasuresComplications of infection; infection transmission or acquisition; diagnostic accuracy of anatomical site-specific testing and collection methods; screening harms. ResultsTwenty-seven studies were included (N=179515). Chlamydia screening compared with no screening was significantly associated with reduced risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in 2 of 4 trials and with reduced hospital-diagnosed PID (0.24% vs 0.38%); relative risk, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.4-1.0]), but not clinic-diagnosed PID or epididymitis, in the largest trial. In studies of risk prediction instruments in asymptomatic women, age younger than 22 years demonstrated comparable accuracy to extensive criteria. Sensitivity of chlamydial testing was similar at endocervical (89%-100%) and self- and clinician-collected vaginal (90%-100%) sites for women and at meatal (100%), urethral (99%), and rectal (92%) sites for men but lower at pharyngeal sites (69.2%) for men who have sex with men. Sensitivity of gonococcal testing was 89% or greater for all anatomical samples. False-positive and false-negative testing rates were low across anatomical sites and collection methods. Conclusions and RelevanceScreening for chlamydial infection was significantly associated with a lower risk of PID in young women. Risk prediction criteria demonstrated limited accuracy beyond age. Testing for asymptomatic chlamydial and gonococcal infections was highly accurate at most anatomical sites, including urine and self-collected specimens. Effectiveness of screening in men and during pregnancy, optimal screening intervals, and adverse effects of screening require further evaluation. This systematic review to support the 2021 US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement on screening for chlamydial and gonococcal infections summarizes published evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for chlamydial and gonococcal infection in adults and adolescents, including those who are pregnant.","[Cantor, Amy; Dana, Tracy; Griffin, Jessica C.; Weeks, Chandler; Chou, Roger] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Med Informat & Clin Epidemiol, Northwest Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Cantor, Amy] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Family Med, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Cantor, Amy] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Nelson, Heidi D.] Kaiser Permanente Bernard J Tyson Sch Med, Pasadena, CA USA; [Winthrop, Kevin L.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, Portland, OR 97201 USA",,"Cantor, A (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",cantor@ohsu.edu,,"Cantor, Amy/0000-0002-4467-8484",,,,,45,7,7,0,0,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Known modifiable risk factors for CVD include smoking, overweight and obesity, diabetes, elevated blood pressure or hypertension, dyslipidemia, lack of physical activity, and unhealthy diet. Adults who adhere to national guidelines for a healthy diet and physical activity have lower cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than those who do not. All persons, regardless of their CVD risk status, benefit from healthy eating behaviors and appropriate physical activity. ObjectiveTo update its 2014 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on behavioral counseling to promote a healthy diet and physical activity for CVD prevention in adults with cardiovascular risk factors. PopulationThis recommendation statement applies to adults 18 years or older with known hypertension or elevated blood pressure, those with dyslipidemia, or those who have mixed or multiple risk factors such as metabolic syndrome or an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% or greater. Adults with other known modifiable cardiovascular risk factors such as abnormal blood glucose levels, obesity, and smoking are not included in this recommendation.

Importance Worldwide, the burden of heart failure has increased to an estimated 23 million people, and approximately 50% of cases are HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Observations Heart failure is a clinical syndrome characterized by dyspnea or exertional limitation due to impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood or both. HFrEF occurs when the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 40% or less and is accompanied by progressive left ventricular dilatation and adverse cardiac remodeling. Assessment for heart failure begins with obtaining a medical history and physical examination. Also central to diagnosis are elevated natriuretic peptides above age- and context-specific thresholds and identification of left ventricular systolic dysfunction with LVEF of 40% or less as measured by echocardiography. Treatment strategies include the use of diuretics to relieve symptoms and application of an expanding armamentarium of disease-modifying drug and device therapies. Unless there are specific contraindications, patients with HFrEF should be treated with a beta-blocker and one of an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker as foundational therapy, with addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist in patients with persistent symptoms. Ivabradine and hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate also have a role in the care of certain patients with HFrEF. More recently, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have further improved disease outcomes, significantly reducing cardiovascular and all-cause mortality irrespective of diabetes status, and vericiguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, reduces heart failure hospitalization in high-risk patients with HFrEF. Device therapies may be beneficial in specific subpopulations, such as cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with interventricular dyssynchrony, transcatheter mitral valve repair in patients with severe secondary mitral regurgitation, and implantable cardiac defibrillators in patients with more severe left ventricular dysfunction particularly of ischemic etiology. Conclusions and Relevance HFrEF is a major public health concern with substantial morbidity and mortality. The management of HFrEF has seen significant scientific breakthrough in recent decades, and the ability to alter the natural history of the disease has never been better. Recent developments include SGLT2 inhibitors, vericiguat, and transcatheter mitral valve repair, all of which incrementally improve prognosis beyond foundational neurohormonal therapies. Disease morbidity and mortality remain high, with a 5-year survival rate of 25% after hospitalization for HFrEF.","[Murphy, Sean P.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ibrahim, Nasrien E.; Januzzi, James L., Jr.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Med, Div Cardiol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Ibrahim, Nasrien E.; Januzzi, James L., Jr.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Januzzi, James L., Jr.] Baim Inst Clin Res, Boston, MA USA",,"Januzzi, JL (corresponding author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, 55 Fruit St, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",jjanuzzi@partners.org,,,Dennis and Marilyn Barry fund for cardiology research; Hutter Family Professorship,Dennis and Marilyn Barry fund for cardiology research; Hutter Family Professorship,Dr Ibrahim is supported in part by the Dennis and Marilyn Barry fund for cardiology research.

Antipsychotic drugs are its treatment of choice, but there is controversy about which agent should be used. We aimed to compare and rank antipsychotics by quantifying information from randomised controlled trials. Methods We did a network meta-analysis of placebo-controlled and head-to-head randomised controlled trials and compared 32 antipsychotics. We searched Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, BIOSIS, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov from database inception to Jan 8, 2019. Two authors independently selected studies and extracted data. We included randomised controlled trials in adults with acute symptoms of schizophrenia or related disorders. We excluded studies in patients with treatment resistance, first episode, predominant negative or depressive symptoms, concomitant medical illnesses, and relapse-prevention studies. Our primary outcome was change in overall symptoms measured with standardised rating scales. We also extracted data for eight efficacy and eight safety outcomes. Differences in the findings of the studies were explored in metaregressions and sensitivity analyses. Effect size measures were standardised mean differences, mean differences, or risk ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrIs). Confidence in the evidence was assessed using CINeMA (Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis). The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42014014919. Findings We identified 54 417 citations and included 402 studies with data for 53 463 participants. Effect size estimates suggested all antipsychotics reduced overall symptoms more than placebo (although not statistically significant for six drugs), with standardised mean differences ranging from -0.89 (95% CrI -1.08 to -0.71) for clozapine to -0.03 (-0.59 to 0.52) for levomepromazine (40 815 participants). Standardised mean differences compared with placebo for reduction of positive symptoms (31 179 participants) varied from -0.69 (95% CrI -0.86 to -0.52) for amisulpride to -0.17 (-0.31 to -0.04) for brexpiprazole, for negative symptoms (32 015 participants) from -0.62 (-0.84 to -0.39; clozapine) to -0.10 (-0.45 to 0.25; flupentixol), for depressive symptoms (19 683 participants) from -0.90 (-1.36 to -0.44; sulpiride) to 0.04 (-0.39 to 0.47; flupentixol). Risk ratios compared with placebo for all-cause discontinuation (42 672 participants) ranged from 0.52 (0.12 to 0.95; clopenthixol) to 1.15 (0.36 to 1.47; pimozide), for sedation (30 770 participants) from 0.92 (0.17 to 2.03; pimozide) to 10.20 (4.72 to 29.41; zuclopenthixol), for use of antiparkinson medication (24 911 participants) from 0.46 (0.19 to 0.88; clozapine) to 6.14 (4.81 to 6.55; pimozide). Mean differences compared to placebo for weight gain (28 317 participants) ranged from -0.16 kg (-0.73 to 0.40; ziprasidone) to 3.21 kg (2.10 to 4.31; zotepine), for prolactin elevation (21 569 participants) from -77.05 ng/mL (-120.23 to -33.54; clozapine) to 48.51 ng/mL (43.52 to 53.51; paliperidone) and for QTc prolongation (15 467 participants) from -2.21 ms (-4.54 to 0.15; lurasidone) to 23.90 ms (20.56 to 27.33; sertindole). Conclusions for the primary outcome did not substantially change after adjusting for possible effect moderators or in sensitivity analyses (eg, when excluding placebo-controlled studies). The confidence in evidence was often low or very low. Interpretation There are some efficacy differences between antipsychotics, but most of them are gradual rather than discrete. Differences in side-effects are more marked. These findings will aid clinicians in balancing risks versus benefits of those drugs available in their countries. They should consider the importance of each outcome, the patients' medical problems, and preferences. Copyright (C) 2019 The Author(s).

Given the increasing use of CS, particularly without medical indication, an increased understanding of its health effects on women and children has become crucial, which we discuss in this Series paper. The prevalence of maternal mortality and maternal morbidity is higher after CS than after vaginal birth. CS is associated with an increased risk of uterine rupture, abnormal placentation, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, and preterm birth, and these risks increase in a dose-response manner. There is emerging evidence that babies born by CS have different hormonal, physical, bacterial, and medical exposures, and that these exposures can subtly alter neonatal physiology. Short-term risks of CS include altered immune development, an increased likelihood of allergy, atopy, and asthma, and reduced intestinal gut microbiome diversity. The persistence of these risks into later life is less well investigated, although an association between CS use and greater incidence of late childhood obesity and asthma are frequently reported. There are few studies that focus on the effects of CS on cognitive and educational outcomes. Understanding potential mechanisms that link CS with childhood outcomes, such as the role of the developing neonatal microbiome, has potential to inform novel strategies and research for optimising CS use and promote optimal physiological processes and development.","[Sandall, Jane; Tribe, Rachel M.; Kelly, Niamh M.; Taylor, Paul] Kings Coll London, Fac Life Sci & Med, Sch Life Course Sci, Dept Women & Childrens Hlth, St Thomas Hosp Campus, London SE1 7EH, England; [Gibbons, Deena] Kings Coll London, Sch Immunol & Microbial Sci, Peter Gorer Dept Immunobiol, London, England; [Avery, Lisa] Univ Manitoba, Max Rady Coll Med, Rady Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Community Hlth Sci,Ctr Global Publ Hlth, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Mola, Glen] Univ Papua New Guinea, Sch Med & Hlth Sci, Port Moresby, Papua N Guinea; [Mola, Glen] Dept Obstet, Port Moresby, Papua N Guinea; [Mola, Glen] Gen Hosp, Port Moresby, Papua N Guinea; [Visser, Gerard H.

Surgery is the cornerstone of cure; the optimal approach depends on the anatomical site of the primary tumour and the best outcomes are achieved through management by specialist multidisciplinary teams. Unfortunately, most patients present with locally advanced or metastatic disease. Most studies in advanced disease have pooled the various subtypes of biliary tract cancer by necessity to achieve adequate sample sizes; however, differences in epidemiology, clinical presentation, natural history, surgical therapy, response to treatment, and prognosis have long been recognised. Additionally, the identification of distinct patient subgroups harbouring unique molecular alterations with corresponding targeted therapies (such as isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 mutations and fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 fissions in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinorna, among others) is changing the treatment paradigm. In this Seminar we present an update of the causes, diagnosis, molecular classification, and treatment of biliary tract cancer.","[Valle, Juan W.] Univ Manchester, Div Canc Sci, Manchester M20 4BX, Lancs, England; [Valle, Juan W.] Christie NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Med Oncol, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Kelley, R.

Few areas in medicine have progressed as remarkably as heart failure treatment over the past three decades. However, progress has been consistent only for chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. In acutely decompensated heart failure and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, none of the treatments tested to date have been definitively proven to improve survival. Delaying or preventing heart failure has become increasingly important in patients who are prone to heart failure. The prevention of worsening chronic heart failure and hospitalisations for acute decompensation is also of great importance. The objective of this Series paper is to provide a concise and practical summary of the available drug treatments for heart failure. We support the implementation of the international guidelines. We offer views on the basis of our personal experience in research areas that have insufficient evidence. The best possible evidence-based drug treatment (including inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and beta blockers) is useful only when optimally implemented. However, implementation might be challenging. We believe that disease management programmes can be helpful in providing a multidisciplinary, holistic approach to the delivery of optimal medical care.","[Rossignol, Patrick; Zannad, Faiez] Univ Lorraine, CHRU Nancy, INSERM, Ctr Invest Clin Plurithemat 1433,U1116, Nancy, France; [Rossignol, Patrick; Zannad, Faiez] French Clin Res Network Invest Network Initiat Ca, Nancy, France; [Hernandez, Adrian F.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Cardiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Solomon, Scott D.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Cardiovasc Div, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,"Rossignol, P (corresponding author), CHRU Nancy, Ctr Invest Clin, F-54500 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France.",p.rossignol@chru-nancy.fr,"Hernandez, Adrian F/A-7818-2016","Hernandez, Adrian F/0000-0003-3387-9616","French National Research Agency [ANR-15-RHU-0004, ANR-15-IDEX-04-LUE]; Contrat de Plan Etat Region Lorraine; FEDER [IT2MP]; Centre Hospitalier Regional Universitaire de Nancy",French National Research Agency(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Contrat de Plan Etat Region Lorraine; FEDER(European Commission); Centre Hospitalier Regional Universitaire de Nancy,"The authors acknowledge the contributions of Wendy Gattis Stough, who was funded by Centre Hospitalier Regional Universitaire de Nancy, for editing and assisting with the preparation of the manuscript.

However, widespread gaps in the quality of primary health care still exist. In this Review, we aim to identify the causes for this poor quality, and provide policy recommendations. System challenges include: the suboptimal education and training of primary health-care practitioners, a fee-for-service payment system that incentivises testing and treatments over prevention, fragmentation of clinical care and public health service, and insufficient continuity of care throughout the entire health-care system. The following recommendations merit consideration: (1) enhancement of the quality of training for primary healthcare physicians, (2) establishment of performance accountability to incentivise high-quality and high-value care; (3) integration of clinical care with the basic public health services, and (4) strengthening of the coordination between primary health-care institutions and hospitals. Additionally, China should consider modernising its primary health-care system through the establishment of a learning health system built on digital data and innovative technologies.","[Li, Xi; Lu, Jiapeng; Su, Meng; Zhang, Qiuli; Li, Jing; Wang, Zengwu; Yan, Hongbing; Gao, Runlin; Hu, Shengshou] Chinese Acad Med Sci & Peking Union Med Coll, Natl Clin Res Ctr Cardiovasc Dis, Fuwai Hosp, Natl Ctr Cardiovasc Dis, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Xi; Lu, Jiapeng; Li, Jing; Yan, Hongbing; Hu, Shengshou] Chinese Acad Med Sci, Fuwai Hosp, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Krumholz, Harlan M.] Yale Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Sect Cardiovasc Med, New Haven, CT USA; [Krumholz, Harlan M.] Yale Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, New Haven, CT USA; [Krumholz, Harlan M.] Yale New Haven Med Ctr, Ctr Outcomes Res & Evaluat, 20 York St, New Haven, CT 06504 USA; [Yip, Winnie] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth & Populat, Boston, MA USA; [Normand, Sharon-Lise T.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA USA; [Normand, Sharon-Lise T.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Hlth Care Policy, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Cheng, Kar Keung] Univ Birmingham, Inst Appl Hlth Res, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Cheng, Kar Keung] Peking Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Gen Practice Dev & Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ke, Yang] Peking Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Sch Oncol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Meng, Qingyue; Li, Liming] Peking Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Sch Publ Hlth, Beijing, Peoples R China; [De Maeseneer, Jan] Univ Ghent, Ctr Family Med, Dept Publ Hlth & Primary Care, Ghent, Belgium; [Mossialos, Elias] Imperial Coll London, London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Hlth Policy, London, England; [Mossialos, Elias] Imperial Coll London, Inst Global Hlth Innovat, London, England; [Li, Chuang] Hlth Commiss Shenzhen Municipal, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qiuli] Univ Edinburgh, Usher Inst Populat Hlth Sci & Informat, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Xu, Dong Roman] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sun Yat Sen Global Hlth Inst, Sch Publ Hlth, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Xu, Dong Roman] Inst State Governance, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Peto, Richard] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Oxford, England; [Chunharas, Somsak] Natl Hlth Fdn, Bangkok, Thailand; [Gao, Xin] Xizhuangzi Village Clin, Jinchang, Peoples R China; [Guerra, Raniero] WHO Headquarters, Director Gen Off, Geneva, Switzerland; [Ji, Huijie] Yaojia Township Primary Care Clin, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China; [Pan, Zhigang; Zhu, Shanzhu] Fudan Univ, Zhongshan Hosp, Shanghai Med Coll, Dept Gen Practice, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xianping] Sichuan Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Shuiyuan] Cent South Univ, Xiangya Sch Publ Hlth, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Xie, Xinying] Hlth Commiss Yunnan Prov, Kunming, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yujuan] Jijie Township Primary Care Clin, Gejiu, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Jun] Sichuan Univ, West China Second Univ Hosp, Natl Off Maternal & Child Hlth Surveillance China, Dept Obstet, Chengdu, Peoples R China",,"Hu, SS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Med Sci & Peking Union Med Coll, Natl Clin Res Ctr Cardiovasc Dis, State Key Lab Cardiovasc Dis, Natl Ctr Cardiovasc Dis,Fuwai Hosp, Beijing 100037, Peoples R China.",huss@fuwaihospital.org,"Xu, Dong/Z-1502-2019; Cheng, Kar/AAL-8899-2021; wang, zengwu/AAS-9504-2021; Mossialos, Elias/ABE-1301-2021","Xu, Dong/0000-0001-7438-632X; Cheng, Kar/0000-0002-1516-1857; Li, Xi/0000-0003-2249-688X","Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Science [2017-I2M-1-003, 2017-I2M-2-002, 2016-12M-2-004, 2016-12M-1-006]; Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2017YFC1310801, 2017YFC1310803]; Ministry of Finance; National Health and Family Planning Commission of China; China-WHO Biennial Collaborative Projects 2016-2017 [2016/664424-0]; National Health and Family Planning Commission of China [201502009]; Ministry of Education of China [B16005]","Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Science; Ministry of Science and Technology of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); Ministry of Finance; National Health and Family Planning Commission of China; China-WHO Biennial Collaborative Projects 2016-2017; National Health and Family Planning Commission of China; Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China)","We appreciate the multiple contributions made by study teams at the Chinese National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, and the local sites in the collaborative network in the realms of study design and operations, particularly data collection by Na Tian, Jianlan Cui, Xin Sun, Wei Xu, and Bo Gu, and data cleaning and analysis by Shuang Hu, Xueke Bai, and Chaoqun Wu.

Treatment to prevent CVD events by modifying risk factors is currently informed by CVD risk assessment with tools such as the Framingham Risk Score or the Pooled Cohort Equations, which stratify individual risk to inform treatment decisions. OBJECTIVE To update the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for coronary heart disease with electrocardiography (ECG). EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on whether screening with resting or exercise ECG improves health outcomes compared with the use of traditional CVD risk assessment alone in asymptomatic adults. FINDINGS For asymptomatic adults at low risk of CVD events (individuals with a 10-year CVD event risk less than 10%), it is very unlikely that the information from resting or exercise ECG (beyond that obtained with conventional CVD risk factors) will result in a change in the patient's risk category as assessed by the Framingham Risk Score or Pooled Cohort Equations that would lead to a change in treatment and ultimately improve health outcomes. Possible harms are associated with screening with resting or exercise ECG, specifically the potential adverse effects of subsequent invasive testing. For asymptomatic adults at intermediate or high risk of CVD events, there is insufficient evidence to determine the extent to which information from resting or exercise ECG adds to current CVD risk assessment models and whether information from the ECG results in a change in risk management and ultimately reduces CVD events. As with low-risk adults, possible harms are associated with screening with resting or exercise ECG in asymptomatic adults at intermediate or high risk of CVD events. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF recommends against screening with resting or exercise ECG to prevent CVD events in asymptomatic adults at low risk of CVD events. (D recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening with resting or exercise ECG to prevent CVD events in asymptomatic adults at intermediate or high risk of CVD events.

To date, five ADCs have received market approval and over 100 are being investigated in various stages of clinical development. In this Therapeutics paper, we review recent clinical experience with the approved ADCs and other promising late-stage candidates on the horizon, following an overview of the biology and chemistry of ADCs and how the individual components of an ADC (antibody [or target], linker and conjugation chemistry, and cytotoxic payload) influence its activity. We briefly discuss opportunities for enhancing ADC efficacy, drug resistance, and future perspectives for this novel antibody-based molecular platform, which has great potential to make a paradigm shift in cancer chemotherapy.","[Chau, Cindy H.; Figg, William D.] NCI, Mol Pharmacol Sect, Genitourinary Malignancies Branch, Ctr Canc Res,NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Steeg, Patricia S.] NCI, Womens Malignancies Branch, Ctr Canc Res, NIH, Frederick, MD 21701 USA; [Steeg, Patricia S.] NCI, Nat Prod Branch, Dev Therapeut Program, Div Canc Treatment & Diag,NIH, Frederick, MD 21701 USA",,"Figg, WD (corresponding author), NCI, Mol Pharmacol Sect, Genitourinary Malignancies Branch, Ctr Canc Res,NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",figgw@mail.nih.gov,,"Figg, William/0000-0003-2428-5613","Intramural Research Program of the Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, USA","Intramural Research Program of the Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, USA","We thank the Intramural Research Program of the Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, USA, for providing research support.

OBSERVATIONS Early identification and management of IPH is crucial. Blood pressure control, reversal of associated coagulopathy, care in a dedicated stroke unit, and identification of secondary etiologies are essential to optimizing outcomes. Surgical management of hydrocephalus and space occupying hemorrhage in the posterior fossa are accepted forms of treatment. Modern advances in minimally invasive surgical management of primary, supratentorial IPH are being explored in randomized trials. Hemorrhagic arteriovenous malformations and cavernous malformations are surgically excised if accessible, while hemorrhagic dural arteriovenous fistulas and distal/mycotic aneurysms are often managed with embolization if feasible. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE IPH remains a considerable source of neurological morbidity and mortality. Rapid identification, medical management, and neurosurgical management, when indicated, are essential to facilitate recovery. There is ongoing evaluation of minimally invasive approaches for evacuation of primary IPH and evolution of surgical and endovascular techniques in the management of lesions leading to secondary IPH.","[Gross, Bradley A.; Jankowitz, Brian T.; Friedlander, Robert M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Med Ctr, Dept Neurosurg, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",,"Friedlander, RM (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Med Ctr, Dept Neurol Surg, 200 Lothrop St,Ste B-400, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",friedlanderr@upmc.edu,"friedlander, robert/A-2845-2016","friedlander, robert/0000-0003-4423-9219",,,,,77,100,107,13,29,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate new data and treatments and incorporate this information into updated recommendations for initiating therapy, monitoring individuals starting therapy, changing regimens, and preventing HIV infection for individuals at risk. EVIDENCE REVIEW New evidence collected since the International Antiviral Society-USA 2016 recommendations via monthly PubMed and EMBASE literature searches up to April 2018; data presented at peer-reviewed scientific conferences. A volunteer panel of experts in HIV research and patient care considered these data and updated previous recommendations. FINDINGS ART is recommended for virtually all HIV-infected individuals, as soon as possible after HIV diagnosis. Immediate initiation (eg, rapid start), if clinically appropriate, requires adequate staffing, specialized services, and careful selection of medical therapy. An integrase strand transfer inhibitor (InSTI) plus 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) is generally recommended for initial therapy, with unique patient circumstances (eg, concomitant diseases and conditions, potential for pregnancy, cost) guiding the treatment choice. CD4 cell count, HIV RNA level, genotype, and other laboratory tests for general health and co-infections are recommended at specified points before and during ART. If a regimen switch is indicated, treatment history, tolerability, adherence, and drug resistance history should first be assessed; 2 or 3 active drugs are recommended for a new regimen. HIV testing is recommended at least once for anyone who has ever been sexually active and more often for individuals at ongoing risk for infection. Preexposure prophylaxis with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine and appropriate monitoring is recommended for individuals at risk for HIV. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Advances in HIV prevention and treatment with ant retroviral drugs continue to improve clinical management and outcomes for individuals at risk for and living with HIV.","[Saag, Michael S.; Mugavero, Michael J.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL USA; [Benson, Constance A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Gandhi, Rajesh T.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Gandhi, Rajesh T.; Sax, Paul E.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA USA; [Hoy, Jennifer F.] Alfred Hosp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Hoy, Jennifer F.] Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Landovitz, Raphael J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Sax, Paul E.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Smith, Davey M.] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Thompson, Melanie A.] AIDS Res Consortium Atlanta, Atlanta, GA USA; [Buchbinder, Susan P.] San Francisco Dept Publ Hlth, San Francisco, CA USA; [Buchbinder, Susan P.; Volberding, Paul A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [del Rio, Carlos] Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [del Rio, Carlos] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Atlanta, GA USA; [Eron, Joseph J., Jr.] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Faetkenheuer, Gerd] Univ Hosp Cologne, Dept Internal Med 1, Cologne, Germany; [Faetkenheuer, Gerd] Partner Site Bonn Cologne, German Ctr Infect Res, Cologne, Germany; [Gunthard, Huldrych F.] Univ Hosp Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Gunthard, Huldrych F.] Univ Zurich, Inst Med Virol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Molina, Jean-Michel] Univ Paris Diderot, Paris, France; [Molina, Jean-Michel] St Louis Hosp, APHP, Paris, France; [Jacobsen, Donna M.] Int Antiviral Soc USA, San Francisco, CA USA",,"Saag, MS (corresponding author), Univ Alabama Birmingham, Sch Med, 845 19th St S,BBRB 256, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.",msaag@uabmc.edu,"Hoy, Jennifer/AAK-7968-2020; del Rio, Carlos/B-3763-2012; gunthard, huldrych f/F-1724-2011","del Rio, Carlos/0000-0002-0153-3517; gunthard, huldrych f/0000-0002-1142-6723; Smith, Davey/0000-0003-3603-1733","International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES [P30AI036214, P30AI050410] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH [P30MH062512] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)),"The work is sponsored and funded by the International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA).

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of the population-level impact of vaccinating girls and women against human papillomavirus on HPV infections, anogenital wart diagnoses, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+ (CIN2+) to summarise the most recent evidence about the effectiveness of HPV vaccines in real-world settings and to quantify the impact of multiple age-cohort vaccination. Methods In this updated systematic review and meta-analysis, we used the same search strategy as in our previous paper. We searched MEDLINE and Embase for studies published between Feb 1, 2014, and Oct 11, 2018. Studies were eligible if they compared the frequency (prevalence or incidence) of at least one HPV-related endpoint (genital HPV infections, anogenital wart diagnoses, or histologically confirmed CIN2+) between pre-vaccination and post-vaccination periods among the general population and if they used the same population sources and recruitment methods before and after vaccination. Our primary assessment was the relative risk (RR) comparing the frequency (prevalence or incidence) of HPV-related endpoints between the pre-vaccination and post-vaccination periods. We stratified all analyses by sex, age, and years since introduction of HPV vaccination. We used random-effects models to estimate pooled relative risks. Findings We identified 1702 potentially eligible articles for this systematic review and meta-analysis, and included 65 articles in 14 high-income countries: 23 for HPV infection, 29 for anogenital warts, and 13 for CIN2+. After 5-8 years of vaccination, the prevalence of HPV 16 and 18 decreased significantly by 83% (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.11-0.25) among girls aged 13-19 years, and decreased significantly by 66% (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.23-0.49) among women aged 20-24 years. The prevalence of HPV 31, 33, and 45 decreased significantly by 54% (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.33-0.66) among girls aged 13-19 years. Anogenital wart diagnoses decreased significantly by 67% (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.24-0.46) among girls aged 15-19 years, decreased significantly by 54% (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.36-0.60) among women aged 20-24 years, and decreased significantly by 31% (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53-0.89) among women aged 25-29 years. Among boys aged 15-19 years anogenital wart diagnoses decreased significantly by 48% (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.37-0.75) and among men aged 20-24 years they decreased significantly by 32% (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.47-0.98). After 5-9 years of vaccination, CIN2+ decreased significantly by 51% (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.42-0.58) among screened girls aged 15-19 years and decreased significantly by 31% (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.57-0.84) among women aged 20-24 years. Interpretation This updated systematic review and meta-analysis includes data from 60 million individuals and up to 8 years of post-vaccination follow-up. Our results show compelling evidence of the substantial impact of HPV vaccination programmes on HPV infections and CIN2+ among girls and women, and on anogenital warts diagnoses among girls, women, boys, and men. Additionally, programmes with multi-cohort vaccination and high vaccination coverage had a greater direct impact and herd effects. Copyright (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, this rise in numbers of women, or gender diversity, has not been matched by a rise in gender inclusion. Despite increasing representation, women still encounter bias and discrimination when compared with men in these fields across a variety of outcomes, including treatment at school and work, hiring, compensation, evaluation, and promotion. Individual and systemic biases create unwelcome environments for women, particularly for those who additionally identify with other traditionally devalued groups (eg, women of colour). This Review draws on several decades of research in the field of management and its cognate disciplines to identify five myths that continue to perpetuate gender bias and five strategies for improving not only the number of women in medicine, but also their lived experiences, capacity to aspire, and opportunity to succeed. We argue for a move away from a singular focus on interventions aimed at targeting individual attitudes and behaviour to more comprehensive interventions that address structural and systemic changes.","[Kang, Sonia K.] Univ Toronto Mississauga, Inst Management & Innovat, Mississauga, ON, Canada; [Kang, Sonia K.; Kaplan, Sarah] Univ Toronto, Inst Gender & Econ, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Kaplan, Sarah] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Mack Inst Innovat Management, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,"Kang, SK (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada.",sonia.kang@utoronto.ca,", Sarah/AAH-2226-2020",", Sarah/0000-0001-5367-8227",,,,,132,74,73,0,29,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,FEB 9,2019,393,10171,,,,,579,586,,10.1016/S0140-6736(18)33138-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)33138-6,,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),General & Internal Medicine,HK7QO,30739693,Bronze,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000458184300039,View Full Record in Web of Science,14627,1,22,78,26,27,60,69,28,17,77,10,7,32,31,126,28

Objective To review the benefits and harms of interventions to prevent illicit and nonmedical drug use in children, adolescents, and young adults to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force. Data Sources MEDLINE, PubMED, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 1, 2013, to January 31, 2019 [children and adolescents]; January 1, 1992, to January 31, 2019 [young adults <25 years]); surveillance through March 20, 2020. Study Selection Clinical trials of behavioral counseling interventions to prevent initiation of illicit and nonmedical drug use among young people. Data Extraction and Synthesis Critical appraisal was completed independently by 2 investigators. Data were extracted by 1 reviewer and checked by a second. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the effect sizes associated with the interventions. Main Outcomes and Measures Number of times illicit drugs were used; any illicit drug or any cannabis use. Results Twenty-nine trials (N = 18& x202f;353) met inclusion criteria. Health, social, or legal outcomes such as mental health symptoms, family functioning, consequences of drug use, and arrests were reported in 19 trials and most showed no group differences. The effects on illicit drug use in 26 trials among nonpregnant youth (n = 17& x202f;811) were highly variable; the pooled result did not show a clinically important or statistically significant association with illicit drug use (standardized mean difference, -0.08 [95% CI, -0.16 to 0.001]; 24 effects [from 23 studies]; n = 12& x202f;801; I-2 = 57.0%). The percentage of participants using illicit drugs ranged from 2.3% to 38.6% in the control groups and 2.4% to 33.7% in the intervention groups at 3 to 32 months' follow-up. The median absolute risk difference between groups was -2.8%, favoring the intervention group (range, -11.5% to 14.8%). The remaining 3 trials provided a perinatal home-visiting intervention to pregnant Native American youth. One trial (n=322) found a reduction in illicit drug use at 38 months (eg, cannabis use in the previous month, 10.7% in the intervention group and 15.6% in the control group) but not at earlier follow-up assessments. Across all 29 trials, only 1 trial reported on harms and found no statistically significant group differences. Conclusions and Relevance The evidence for behavioral counseling interventions to prevent initiation of illicit and nonmedical drug use among adolescents and young adults was inconsistent and imprecise, with some interventions associated with reduction in use and others associated with no benefit or increased use. Health, social, and legal outcomes were sparsely reported, and few showed improvements. This systematic review to support the 2020 US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement on interventions to prevent illicit and nonmedical drug use summarizes published evidence on the benefits and harms of primary care-based interventions to prevent illicit and nonmedical drug use in children, adolescents, and young adults.","[O'Connor, Elizabeth; Thomas, Rachel; Senger, Caitlyn A.; Perdue, Leslie; Patnode, Carrie] Kaiser Permanente, Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Ctr Hlth Res, Portland, OR USA; [Robalino, Shannon] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Ctr Evidence Based Policy, Portland, OR 97201 USA",,"O'Connor, E (corresponding author), Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Kaiser Permanente, Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Ctr Hlth Res, 3800 N Interstate Ave, Portland, OR 97227 USA.",Elizabeth.OConnor@kpchr.org,"Robalino, Shannon/N-4113-2015","Robalino, Shannon/0000-0002-6359-1827","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA-290-2015-000017-I-EPC5]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA-290-2015-000017-I-EPC5, Task Order 5, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the USPSTF.",,67,10,10,0,3,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Physical activity fosters normal growth and development and can make people feel, function, and sleep better and reduce risk of many chronic diseases. OBJECTIVE To summarize key guidelines in the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition (PAG). PROCESS AND EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee conducted a systematic review of the science supporting physical activity and health. The committee addressed 38 questions and 104 subquestions and graded the evidence based on consistency and quality of the research. Evidence graded as strong or moderate was the basis of the key guidelines. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) based the PAG on the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report. RECOMMENDATIONS The PAG provides information and guidance on the types and amounts of physical activity to improve a variety of health outcomes for multiple population groups. Preschool-aged children (3 through 5 years) should be physically active throughout the day to enhance growth and development. Children and adolescents aged 6 through 17 years should do 60 minutes or more of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily. Adults should do at least 150 minutes to 300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes to 150 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate-and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. They should also do muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week. Older adults should do multicomponent physical activity that includes balance training as well as aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Pregnant and postpartum women should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week. Adults with chronic conditions or disabilities, who are able, should follow the key guidelines for adults and do both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Recommendations emphasize that moving more and sitting less will benefit nearly everyone. Individuals performing the least physical activity benefit most by even modest increases in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Additional benefits occur with more physical activity. Both aerobic and muscle-strengthening physical activity are beneficial. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition, provides information and guidance on the types and amounts of physical activity that provide substantial health benefits. Health professionals and policy makers should facilitate awareness of the guidelines and promote the health benefits of physical activity and support efforts to implement programs, practices, and policies to facilitate increased physical activity and to improve the health of the US population.","[Piercy, Katrina L.; Olson, Richard D.] US Dept HHS, Off Dis Prevent & Hlth Promot, Rockville, MD USA; [Troiano, Richard P.] NCI, NIH, US Dept HHS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Ballard, Rachel M.; George, Stephanie M.] NIH, US Dept HHS, Off Dis Prevent, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Carlson, Susan A.; Fulton, Janet E.; Galuska, Deborah A.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Chron Dis Prevent & Hlth Promot, US Dept HHS, Atlanta, GA USA",,"Olson, RD (corresponding author), NCI, Div Canc Control & Populat Sci, 9609 Med Ctr Dr,Room 4E 138, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",troianor@mail.nih.gov,"Troiano, Richard/AAK-3540-2021","Troiano, Richard/0000-0002-6807-989X",US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),This study was funded by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).,,22,1745,1788,34,234,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Although adolescent spinal deformities taken into adulthood are not uncommon, the most usual causes of spinal deformity in adults are iatrogenic flatback and degenerative scoliosis. Given its prevalence in the expanding portion of the global population aged older than 65 years, the disorder is of growing interest in health care. Physical examination, with a focus on gait and posture, along with radiographical assessment are primarily used and integrated with risk stratification indices to establish optimal treatment planning. Although non-operative treatment is regarded as the first-line response, surgical outcomes are considerably favourable. Global disparities exist in both the assessment and treatment of adults with spinal deformity across countries of varying incomes, which represents an area requiring further investigation. This Seminar presents evidence and knowledge that represent the evolution of data related to spinal deformity in adults over the past several decades.","[Diebo, Bassel G.; Shah, Neil, V; Paulino, Carl B.] State Univ New York, Downstate Med Ctr, Dept Orthopaed Surg & Rehabil Med, New York, NY 11203 USA; [Boachie-Adjei, Oheneba] FOCOS Hosp, Div Complex Spine Deform, Accra, Ghana; [Zhu, Feng] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Orthopaed & Traumatol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Rothenfluh, Dominique A.] Oxford Univ Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Div Spinal Surg, Oxford, England; [Schwab, Frank J.; Lafage, Virgirlie] Hosp Special Surg, Spine Serv, 535 E 70th St, New York, NY 10021 USA",,"Diebo, BG (corresponding author), State Univ New York, Downstate Med Ctr, Dept Orthopaed Surg & Rehabil Med, New York, NY 11203 USA.",dr.basseldiebo@gmail.com,"Diebo, Bassel G./G-8835-2015; Shah, Neil V./K-1839-2019; Lafage, Virginie/E-7747-2010","Diebo, Bassel G./0000-0002-7835-2263; Shah, Neil V./0000-0002-3439-3071; Lafage, Virginie/0000-0002-0119-7111",,,,,139,81,90,7,25,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,JUL 13,2019,394,10193,,,,,160,172,,10.1016/S0140-6736(19)31125-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(19)31125-0,,,13,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,II7TG,31305254,,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000475393900030,View Full Record in Web of Science,15000,1,138,47,137,50,20,7,83,26,94,59,48,87,16,92,46

Arterial gas embolism, in which bubbles introduced into the arterial circulation cause multifocal ischemia, may occur after diving-related, iatrogenic, or accidental pulmonary barotrauma or by direct iatrogenic introduction of gas into the vasculature. Because it may be difficult to clinically differentiate decompression sickness from arterial gas embolism in divers and the treatment protocols for the two disorders are the same, the term decompression illness is sometimes used to indicate the presence of decompression sickness, arterial gas embolism, or both, but the separate terms are used here. Divers with nonspecific symptoms may present to clinicians who have received no specific training during medical school or residency in dealing with these disorders, which can pose challenges in the differential diagnosis and choice of appropriate treatment.","[Mitchell, Simon J.] Univ Auckland, Sch Med, Auckland, New Zealand; [Mitchell, Simon J.] Auckland City Hosp, Dept Anaesthesia, Auckland, New Zealand; [Bennett, Michael H.] Univ New South Wales, Prince Wales Clin Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Bennett, Michael H.] Prince Wales Hosp, Wales Anaesthesia, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Moon, Richard E.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Anesthesiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Moon, Richard E.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Moon, Richard E.] Duke Univ, Ctr Hyperbar Med & Environm Physiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA",,"Mitchell, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Dept Anaesthesiol, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",sj.mitchell@auckland.ac.nz,,"Mitchell, Simon/0000-0002-5149-6371; Moon, Richard E/0000-0003-4432-0332",,,,,80,1,1,4,4,MASSACHUSETTS MEDICAL SOC,WALTHAM,"WALTHAM WOODS CENTER, 860 WINTER ST,, WALTHAM, MA 02451-1413 USA",0028-4793,1533-4406,,NEW ENGL J MED,N.

Outbreaks of MM have occurred across multiple global regions since 2012, and the disease appears to be caused by non-polio enterovirus infection, posing a major public health challenge. The clinical presentation of flaccid and often profound muscle weakness (which can invoke respiratory failure and other critical complications) can mimic several other acute neurological illnesses. There is no single sensitive and specific test for MM, and the diagnosis relies on identification of several important clinical, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid characteristics. Following the acute phase of AFM, patients typically have substantial residual disability and unique long-term rehabilitation needs. In this Review we describe the epidemiology, clinical features, course, and outcomes of AFM to help to guide diagnosis, management, and rehabilitation. Future research directions include further studies evaluating host and pathogen factors, including investigations into genetic, viral, and immunological features of affected patients, host-virus interactions, and investigations of targeted therapeutic approaches to improve the long-term outcomes in this population.","[Murphy, Olwen C.; Elrick, Matthew J.; Pardo, Carlos A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Crawford, Thomas] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Sadowsky, Cristina L.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Pardo, Carlos A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Messacar, Kevin] Childrens Hosp Colorado, Dept Pediat Infect Dis, Aurora, CO USA; [Oleszek, Joyce] Childrens Hosp Colorado, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Aurora, CO USA; [Schreiner, Teri L.] Childrens Hosp Colorado, Dept Child Neurol, Aurora, CO USA; [Benson, Leslie] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Neurol, Boston Childrens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bove, Riley] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol, Weill Inst Neurosci, San Francisco, CA USA; [Carpenter, Jessica L.; Wells, Elizabeth M.] Childrens Natl Hlth Syst, Dept Neurol, Washington, DC USA; [DeBiasi, Roberta] Childrens Natl Hlth Syst, Dept Pediat Infect Dis, Washington, DC USA; [Dean, Janet; Sadowsky, Cristina L.] Kennedy Krieger Inst, Int Ctr Spinal Cord Injury, Baltimore, MD USA; [Desai, Jay] Childrens Hosp Los Angeles, Div Neurol, Los Angeles, CA 90027 USA; [Farias-Moeller, Raquel; Harmelink, Matthew] Childrens Hosp Wisconsin, Dept Neurol, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Farias-Moeller, Raquel; Harmelink, Matthew] Med Coll Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA; [Gombolay, Grace Y.] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Childrens Healthcare Atlanta, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Greenberg, Benjamin] Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Neurol, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Hong, Sue] Northwestern Univ, Div Pediat Crit Care, Ann & Robert H Lurie Childrens Hosp Chicago, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Hopkins, Sarah E.] Univ Penn, Childrens Hosp Philadelphia, Div Neurol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Otten, Catherine] Seattle Childrens Hosp, Dept Pediat Neurol, Seattle, WA USA; [Thakur, Kiran T.] Columbia Univ, Dept Neurol, Irving Med Ctr, New York, NY USA; [Van Haren, Keith] Stanford Univ, Dept Neurol & Neurol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Carballo, Carolina M.; Lopez, Eduardo L.] Hosp Ninos Dr Ricardo Gutierrez, Dept Infect Dis, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Chong, Pin Fee; Kira, Ryutaro] Fukuoka Childrens Hosp, Dept Pediat Neurol, Fukuoka, Japan; [Fall, Amary] Inst Pasteur, Dept Virol, Dakar, Senegal; [Gowda, Vykuntaraju K.] Indira Gandhi Inst Child Hlth, Dept Pediat Neurol, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Helfferich, Jelte] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Neurol, Groningen, Netherlands; [Lim, Ming] Guys & St Thomas NHS Trust, Childrens Neurosci Ctr, Evelina London Childrens Hosp, London, England; [Yeh, E.

OBJECTIVE To describe research on screening and interventions for social risk factors to inform US Preventive Services Task Force considerations of the implications for its portfolio of recommendations. DATA SOURCES Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, Sociological Abstracts, and Social Services Abstracts (through 2018); Social Interventions Research and Evaluation Network evidence library (January 2019 through May 2021); surveillance through May 21, 2021; interviews with 17 key informants. STUDY SELECTION Individual-level and health care system-level interventions with a link to the health care system that addressed at least 1 of 7 social risk domains: housing instability, food insecurity, transportation difficulties, utility needs, interpersonal safety, education, and financial strain. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS One investigator abstracted data from studies and a second investigator evaluated data abstractions for completeness and accuracy; key informant interviews were recorded, transcribed, summarized, and integrated with evidence from the literature; narrative synthesis with supporting tables and figures. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Validity of multidomain social risk screening tools; all outcomes reported for social risk-related interventions; challenges or unintended consequences of screening and interventions. RESULTS Many multidomain social risk screening tools have been developed, but they vary widely in their assessment of social risk and few have been validated. This technical brief identified 106 social risk intervention studies (N = 5 978 596). Of the interventions studied, 73 (69%; n = 127 598) addressed multiple social risk domains. The most frequently addressed domains were food insecurity (67/106 studies [63%], n = 141 797), financial strain (52/106 studies [49%], n = 111 962), and housing instability (63/106 studies [59%], n = 5 881 222). Food insecurity, housing instability, and transportation difficulties were identified by key informants as the most important social risk factors to identify in health care. Thirty-eight studies (36%, n = 5 850 669) used an observational design with no comparator, and 19 studies (18%, n = 15 205) were randomized clinical trials. Health care utilization measures were the most commonly reported outcomes in the 68 studies with a comparator (38 studies [56%], n = 111 102). The literature and key informants described many perceived or potential challenges to implementation of social risk screening and interventions in health care. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Many interventions to address food insecurity, financial strain, and housing instability have been studied, but more randomized clinical trials that report health outcomes from social risk screening and intervention are needed to guide widespread implementation in health care.","[Eder, Michelle; Henninger, Michelle; Iacocca, Megan O.; Martin, Allea; Lin, Jennifer S.] Kaiser Permanente, Ctr Hlth Res, Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Portland, OR USA; [Durbin, Shauna] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Healthcare Policy & Res, Sacramento, CA 95616 USA; [Gottlieb, Laura M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Family & Community Med, San Francisco, CA USA",,"Eder, M (corresponding author), Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Kaiser Permanente Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Ctr Hlth Res, 3800 N Interstate Ave, Portland, OR 97227 USA.",Michelle.L.Eder@kpchr.org,,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA-290-2015-00007-I-EPC5]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA-290-2015-00007-I-EPC5, Task Order 7, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).",,165,9,8,1,1,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

The disorder is associated with a range of mental and general medical comorbid disorders, and with increased mortality. Although genetics are important in opioid use disorder, younger age, male sex, and lower educational attainment level and income, increase the risk of opioid use disorder, as do certain psychiatric disorders (eg, other substance use disorders and mood disorders). The medications for opioid use disorder, which include methadone, buprenorphine, and extended-release naltrexone, significantly improve opioid use disorder outcomes. However, the effectiveness of medications for opioid use disorder is limited by problems at all levels of the care cascade, including diagnosis, entry into treatment, and retention in treatment. There is an urgent need for expanding the use of medications for opioid use disorder, including training of health-care professionals in the treatment and prevention of opioid use disorder, and for development of alternative medications and new models of care to expand capabilities for personalised interventions.","[Blanco, Carlos; Volkow, Nora D.] NIDA, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",,"Blanco, C (corresponding author), NIDA, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",carlos.blanco2@nih.gov,,,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM [ZIAAA000550] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA)),,,145,156,157,4,35,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,APR 27,2019,393,10182,,,,,1760,1772,,10.1016/S0140-6736(18)33078-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)33078-2,,,13,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),General & Internal Medicine,HV8PQ,30878228,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000466244500033,View Full Record in Web of Science,15842,1,87,46,129,43,44,2,15,102,82,134,142,140,23,45,95

In 2015, almost half of all persons began pregnancy with overweight (24%) or obesity (24%). Reported rates of overweight and obesity are higher among Black, Alaska Native/American Indian, and Hispanic women and lower among White and Asian women. Excess weight at the beginning of pregnancy and excess gestational weight gain have been associated with adverse maternal and infant health outcomes such as a large for gestational age infant, cesarean delivery, or preterm birth. ObjectiveThe USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of behavioral counseling interventions to prevent adverse health outcomes associated with obesity during pregnancy and to evaluate intermediate outcomes, including excess gestational weight gain. This is a new recommendation. PopulationPregnant adolescents and adults in primary care settings. Evidence AssessmentThe USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that behavioral counseling interventions aimed at promoting healthy weight gain and preventing excess gestational weight gain in pregnancy have a moderate net benefit for pregnant persons. RecommendationThe USPSTF recommends that clinicians offer pregnant persons effective behavioral counseling interventions aimed at promoting healthy weight gain and preventing excess gestational weight gain in pregnancy. (B recommendation) This 2021 Recommendation Statement from the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that clinicians offer pregnant persons effective behavioral counseling interventions aimed at promoting healthy weight gain and preventing excess gestational weight gain in pregnancy (B recommendation).","[Davidson, Karina W.] Northwell Hlth, Feinstein Inst Med Res, Manhasset, NY USA; [Barry, Michael J.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Mangione, Carol M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Caughey, Aaron B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Davis, Esa M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Donahue, Katrina E.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Doubeni, Chyke A.] Mayo Clin, Rochester, MN USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Fairfax Family Practice Residency, Fairfax, VA USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, VA USA; [Kubik, Martha] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Li, Li] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Ogedegbe, Gbenga] NYU, New York, NY USA; [Pbert, Lori] Univ Massachusetts, Med Sch, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Silverstein, Michael] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Simon, Melissa] Northwestern Univ, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Stevermer, James] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Univ Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Pacific Hlth Res & Educ Inst, Honolulu, HI USA; [Wong, John B.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Cabana, Michael] Albert Einstein Coll Med, New York, NY USA",,"Davidson, KW (corresponding author), Feinstein Inst Med Res, 130 E 59th St,Ste 14C, New York, NY 10032 USA.",chair@uspstf.net,,,,,,,37,10,10,3,10,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

The incidence and mortality rates of the disease differ widely across the globe depending on access to early detection and primary care. Once melanoma has spread, this type of cancer rapidly becomes life-threatening. For more than 40 years, few treatment options were available, and clinical trials during that time were all unsuccessful. Over the past 10 years, increased biological understanding and access to innovative therapeutic substances have transformed advanced melanoma into a new ontological model for treating solid cancers. Treatments that target B-Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine-kinase (BRAF)(V600) (Val600) mutations using selected BRAF inhibitors combined with mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors have significantly improved response and overall survival. Furthermore, advanced cutaneous melanoma has developed into a prototype for testing checkpoint-modulating agents, which has increased hope for long-term tumour containment and a potential cure. These expectations have been sustained by clinical success with targeted agents and antibodies that block programmed cell-death protein 1 in locoregional disease, which induces prolongation of relapse-free, distant-metastasis-free, and overall survival times.","[Schadendorf, Dirk; Griewank, Klaus G.; Roesch, Alexander; Ugurel, Selma] Univ Hosp Essen, Dept Dermatol, D-45122 Essen, Germany; [Schadendorf, Dirk; Griewank, Klaus G.; Roesch, Alexander; Ugurel, Selma] German Canc Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany; [van Akkooi, Alexander C.

Regional variations in reporting frameworks and survival mean the exact burden of OHCA to public health is unknown. Nevertheless, overall prognosis and neurological outcome are relatively poor following OHCA and have remained almost static for the past three decades. In this Series paper, we explore the aetiology of OHCA. Coronary artery disease remains the predominant cause, but there is a diverse range of other potential cardiac and non-cardiac causes to be aware of. Additionally, we describe how investigators and key stakeholders in resuscitation science have formulated specific Utstein data element domains in an attempt to standardise the definitions and outcomes reported in OHCA research so that management pathways can be improved. Finally, we identify the predictors of survival after OHCA and what primary and secondary prevention strategies can be instigated to mitigate the devastating sequelae of this growing public health issue.","[Myat, Aung] Brighton & Sussex Univ Hosp NHS Trust, Sussex Cardiac Ctr, Brighton BN2 5BE, E Sussex, England; [Myat, Aung] Brighton & Sussex Med Sch, Div Clin & Expt Med, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Song, Kyoung-Jun] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Emergency Med, Coll Med & Hosp, Seoul, South Korea; [Song, Kyoung-Jun] Seoul Natl Univ Hosp, Lab Emergency Med Serv, Biomed Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [Rea, Thomas] Univ Washington, Harborview Med Ctr, Div Gen Internal Med, 325 9th Ave, Seattle, WA 98104 USA",,"Myat, A (corresponding author), Brighton & Sussex Univ Hosp NHS Trust, Sussex Cardiac Ctr, Brighton BN2 5BE, E Sussex, England.",aung.myat@bsuh.nhs.uk,"Lee, Jae Hyuk/W-5616-2018","Lee, Jae Hyuk/0000-0003-2429-4085",American Heart Association; Laerdal Foundation; Life Sciences Foundation; Medtronic Philanthropy; National Institutes of Health; Philips Healthcare; PhysioControl,American Heart Association(American Heart Association); Laerdal Foundation; Life Sciences Foundation; Medtronic Philanthropy; National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Philips Healthcare; PhysioControl,"AM and K-JS declare no competing interests.

ObservationsSudden neurologic dysfunction caused by focal brain ischemia with imaging evidence of acute infarction defines acute ischemic stroke (AIS), while an ischemic episode with neurologic deficits but without acute infarction defines transient ischemic attack (TIA). An estimated 7.5% to 17.4% of patients with TIA will have a stroke in the next 3 months. Patients presenting with nondisabling AIS or high-risk TIA (defined as a score >= 4 on the age, blood pressure, clinical symptoms, duration, diabetes [ABCD2] instrument; range, 0-7 [7 indicating worst stroke risk]), who do not have severe carotid stenosis or atrial fibrillation, should receive dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidigrel within 24 hours of presentation. Subsequently, combined aspirin and clopidigrel for 3 weeks followed by single antiplatelet therapy reduces stroke risk from 7.8% to 5.2% (hazard ratio, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.56-0.77]). Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis should receive carotid revascularization and single antiplatelet therapy, and those with atrial fibrillation should receive anticoagulation. In patients presenting with AIS and disabling deficits interfering with activities of daily living, intravenous alteplase improves the likelihood of minimal or no disability by 39% with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV rtPA) vs 26% with placebo (odds ratio [OR], 1.6 [95% CI, 1.1-2.6]) when administered within 3 hours of presentation and by 35.3% with IV rtPA vs 30.1% with placebo (OR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.1-1.5]) when administered within 3 to 4.5 hours of presentation. Patients with disabling AIS due to anterior circulation large-vessel occlusions are more likely to be functionally independent when treated with mechanical thrombectomy within 6 hours of presentation vs medical therapy alone (46.0% vs 26.5%; OR, 2.49 [95% CI, 1.76-3.53]) or when treated within 6 to 24 hours after symptom onset if they have a large ratio of ischemic to infarcted tissue on brain magnetic resonance diffusion or computed tomography perfusion imaging (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2: 53% vs 18%; OR, 4.92 [95% CI, 2.87-8.44]). Conclusions and RelevanceDual antiplatelet therapy initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset and continued for 3 weeks reduces stroke risk in select patients with high-risk TIA and minor stroke. For select patients with disabling AIS, thrombolysis within 4.5 hours and mechanical thrombectomy within 24 hours after symptom onset improves functional outcomes. This narrative review provides an update on management of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and acute ischemic stroke, emphasizing advances in use of dual antiplatelet therapy and fibrinolysis vs mechanical thrombectomy for secondary and tertiary prevention.","[Mendelson, Scott J.; Prabhakaran, Shyam] Univ Chicago, Dept Neurol, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Prabhakaran, Shyam] Univ Chicago, Dept Neurol, Pritzker Sch Med, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",,"Prabhakaran, S (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Pritzker Sch Med, 5841 S Maryland Ave,MC 2030,A-223, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",shyam1@neurology.bsd.uchicago.edu,,,,,,,95,34,37,25,54,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

The SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) statement was published in 2013 and aims to improve the completeness of trial protocols by providing evidence-based recommendations for the minimum set of items to be addressed, but it does not provide PRO-specific guidance. OBJECTIVE To develop international, consensus-based, PRO-specific protocol guidance (the SPIRIT-PRO Extension). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The SPIRIT-PRO Extension was developed following the Enhancing Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) Network's methodological framework for guideline development. This included (1) a systematic review of existing PRO-specific protocol guidance to generate a list of potential PRO-specific protocol items (published in 2014); (2) refinements to the list and removal of duplicate items by the International Society for Quality of Life Research (ISOQOL) Protocol Checklist Taskforce; (3) an international stakeholder survey of clinical trial research personnel, PRO methodologists, health economists, psychometricians, patient advocates, funders, industry representatives, journal editors, policy makers, ethicists, and researchers responsible for evidence synthesis (distributed by 38 international partner organizations in October 2016); (4) an international Delphi exercise (n = 137 invited; October 2016 to February 2017); and (5) consensus meeting (n = 30 invited; May 2017). Prior to voting, consensus meeting participants were informed of the results of the Delphi exercise and given data from structured reviews evaluating the PRO protocol content of 3 defined samples of trial protocols. RESULTS The systematic review identified 162 PRO-specific protocol recommendations from 54 sources. The ISOQOL Taskforce (n = 21) reduced this to 56 items, which were considered by 138 international stakeholder survey participants and 99 Delphi panelists. The final wording of the SPIRIT-PRO Extension was agreed on at a consensus meeting (n = 29 participants) and reviewed by external group of experts during a consultation period. Eleven extensions and 5 elaborations to the SPIRIT 2013 checklist were recommended for inclusion in clinical trial protocols in which PROs are a primary or key secondary outcome. Extension items focused on PRO-specific issues relating to the trial rationale, objectives, eligibility criteria, concepts used to evaluate the intervention, time points for assessment, PRO instrument selection and measurement properties, data collection plan, translation to other languages, proxy completion, strategies to minimize missing data, and whether PRO data will be monitored during the study to inform clinical care. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The SPIRIT-PRO guidelines provide recommendations for items that should be addressed and included in clinical trial protocols in which PROs are a primary or key secondary outcome. Improved design of clinical trials including PROs could help ensure high-quality data that may inform patient-centered care.","[Calvert, Melanie; Kyte, Derek; Slade, Anita] Univ Birmingham, Inst Appl Hlth Res, Ctr Patient Reported Outcome Res, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Mercieca-Bebber, Rebecca; King, Madeleine T.] Univ Sydney, Fac Med, Sydney Med Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Mercieca-Bebber, Rebecca; King, Madeleine T.] Univ Sydney, Fac Sci, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Chan, An-Wen] Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Womens Coll Res Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada",,"Calvert, M (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Inst Appl Hlth Res, Ctr Patient Reported Outcome Res, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",m.calvert@bham.ac.uk,"Calvert, Melanie/F-7055-2011; Slade, Anita/M-3246-2017; Groves, Trish/A-9119-2009","Calvert, Melanie/0000-0002-1856-837X; Slade, Anita/0000-0003-2827-7741; Blazeby, Jane/0000-0002-3354-3330; Hunn, Amanda/0000-0003-2156-7279; Mercieca-Bebber, Rebecca/0000-0003-3708-9099; Groves, Trish/0000-0001-7915-6419; Haywood, Kirstie/0000-0002-5405-187X; Coast, Joanna/0000-0002-3537-5166; brown, julia/0000-0002-2719-7064","Macmillan Cancer Support [5592105]; University of Birmingham; NIHR Birmingham Biomedical Research Centre; NIHR Surgical Reconstruction and Microbiology Research Centre; Australian government through Cancer Australia; MRC ConDuCT-II Hub for Trials Methodology Research; Cancer Research UK [16895] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [G0800800] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0514-10114, PDF-2016-09-009, SPCR-017] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G0800800] Funding Source: UKRI",Macmillan Cancer Support; University of Birmingham; NIHR Birmingham Biomedical Research Centre; NIHR Surgical Reconstruction and Microbiology Research Centre; Australian government through Cancer Australia(Australian Government); MRC ConDuCT-II Hub for Trials Methodology Research; Cancer Research UK(Cancer Research UK); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission); National Institute for Health Research(National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"This work was funded by Macmillan Cancer Support (grant 5592105) and the University of Birmingham and was sponsored by the University of Birmingham.

Despite the unique clinical comorbidities among adults with Down syndrome, there are no clinical guidelines for the care of these patients. OBJECTIVE To develop an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for adults with Down syndrome. EVIDENCE REVIEW The Global Down Syndrome Foundation Medical Care Guidelines for Adults with Down SyndromeWorkgroup (n = 13) developed 10 Population/Intervention/Comparison/Outcome (PICO) questions for adults with Down syndrome addressing multiple clinical areas including mental health (2 questions), dementia, screening or treatment of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, osteoporosis, atlantoaxial instability, thyroid disease, and celiac disease. These questions guided the literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, PsychINFO, Cochrane Library, and the TRIP Database, searched from January 1, 2000, to February 26, 2018, with an updated search through August 6, 2020. Using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology and the Evidence-to-Decision framework, in January 2019, the 13-member Workgroup and 16 additional clinical and scientific experts, nurses, patient representatives, and amethodologist developed clinical recommendations. A statement of good practice was made when there was a high level of certainty that the recommendation would do more good than harm, but there was little direct evidence. FINDINGS From 11 295 literature citations associated with 10 PICO questions, 20 relevant studies were identified. An updated search identified 2 additional studies, for a total of 22 included studies (3 systematic reviews, 19 primary studies), which were reviewed and synthesized. Based on this analysis, 14 recommendations and 4 statements of good practice were developed. Overall, the evidence base was limited. Only 1 strong recommendation was formulated: screening for Alzheimer-type dementia starting at age 40 years. Four recommendations (managing risk factors for cardiovascular disease and stroke prevention, screening for obesity, and evaluation for secondary causes of osteoporosis) agreed with existing guidance for individuals without Down syndrome. Two recommendations for diabetes screening recommend earlier initiation of screening and at shorter intervals given the high prevalence and earlier onset in adults with Down syndrome. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These evidence-based clinical guidelines provide recommendations to support primary care of adults with Down syndrome. The lack of high-quality evidence limits the strength of the recommendations and highlights the need for additional research.","[Tsou, Amy Y.] ECRI Ctr Clin Excellence & Guidelines, Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Plymouth Meeting, PA USA; [Tsou, Amy Y.] Michael J Crescenz Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Div Neurol, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Bulova, Peter] Univ Pittsburgh, Med Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Capone, George] Kennedy Krieger Inst, Syndrome Clin & Res Ctr, Baltimore, MD USA; [Capone, George] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Baltimore, MD USA; [Chicoine, Brian] Adult Syndrome Ctr, Advocate Med Grp, Park Ridge, IL USA; [Gelaro, Bryn; Whitten, Michelle Sie] Global Syndrome Fdn, Denver, CO USA; [Harville, Terry Odell] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Dept Internal Med, Dept Pathol & Lab Serv, Div Hematol, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; [Martin, Barry A.] Univ Colorado, Anschutz Med Ctr, Div Gen Internal Med, Sch Med, Aurora, CO USA; [McKelvey, Kent D.] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; [Peterson, Moya] Univ Kansas, Med Ctr, Sch Nursing & Med, Kansas City, KS 66103 USA; [Tyler, Carl; Wells, Michael] Dev Disabil Practice Based Res Network, Cleveland, OH USA; [Tyler, Carl] Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland Clin, Sch Med, Lerner Coll Med,Family Med & Community Hlth, Cleveland, OH USA",,"Tsou, AY (corresponding author), ECRI, Ctr Clin Excellence & Guidelines, Evidence Based Practice Ctr, 5200 Butler Pike, Plymouth Meeting, PA 19462 USA.",atsou@ECRI.org,"Tyler, Carl/AAX-9396-2021; Chicoine, Brian/AAM-9970-2021","Tsou, Amy/0000-0002-5544-3090",Global Down Syndrome Foundation (GLOBAL); Down syndrome community,Global Down Syndrome Foundation (GLOBAL); Down syndrome community,"This work was funded and supported by the Global Down Syndrome Foundation (GLOBAL; a 501c3 nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the lives of people with Down syndrome through research, medical care, education, and advocacy) and by generous donations from the Down syndrome community (Supplement 1).

Although infections occur globally, and in people of all ages, endemic infections among children aged 1-4 years living in low-income and middle-income settings constitute most of the disease burden. The versatile manifestations of these highly contagious organisms range from acute watery diarrhoea to fulminant dysentery characterised by frequent scant bloody stools with fever, prostration, and abdominal cramps. A broad array of uncommon, but often severe, intestinal and extraintestinal complications can occur. Despite marked reductions in mortality during the past three decades, there are roughly 164 000 annual deaths attributable to shigellosis. Intercontinental dissemination of multiresistant shigella strains, facilitated by travellers and men who have sex with men, has prompted new recommendations for antibiotic therapy. Awareness of disease burden and the emerging threats posed by shigella have accelerated interest in development of shigella vaccines, many of which are being tested in clinical trials.","[Kotloff, Karen L.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Ctr Vaccine Dev, Inst Global Hlth,Dept Pediat, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Kotloff, Karen L.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Ctr Vaccine Dev, Dept Med,Inst Global Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Riddle, Mark S.] Naval Med Res Ctr, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Riddle, Mark S.] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Prevent Med & Biostat, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Platts-Mills, James A.] Univ Virginia, Div Infect Dis & Int Hlth, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Pavlinac, Patricia] Univ Washington, Dept Global Hlth, Global Ctr Integrated Hlth Women Adolescents & Ch, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Zaidi, Anita K.

Chronic pelvic pain accounts for 40% of laparoscopies and 12% of hysterectomies in the US annually even though the origin of CPP is not gynecologic in 80% of patients. Both patients and clinicians are often frustrated by a perceived lack of treatments. This review summarizes the evaluation and management of CPP using recommendations from consensus guidelines to facilitate clinical evaluation, treatment, improved care, and more positive patient-clinician interactions. ObservationsChronic pelvic pain conditions often overlap with nonpelvic pain disorders (eg, fibromyalgia, migraines) and nonpain comorbidities (eg, sleep, mood, cognitive impairment) to contribute to pain severity and disability. Musculoskeletal pain and dysfunction are found in 50% to 90% of patients with CPP. Traumatic experiences and distress have important roles in pain modulation. Complete assessment of the biopsychosocial factors that contribute to CPP requires obtaining a thorough history, educating the patient about pain mechanisms, and extending visit times. Training in trauma-informed care and pelvic musculoskeletal examination are essential to reduce patient anxiety associated with the examination and to avoid missing the origin of myofascial pain. Recommended treatments are usually multimodal and require an interdisciplinary team of clinicians. A single-organ pathological examination should be avoided. Patient involvement, shared decision-making, functional goal setting, and a discussion of expectations for long-term care are important parts of the evaluation process. Conclusions and RelevanceChronic pelvic pain is like other chronic pain syndromes in that biopsychosocial factors interact to contribute and influence pain. To manage this type of pain, clinicians must consider centrally mediated pain factors as well as pelvic and nonpelvic visceral and somatic structures that can generate or contribute to pain. This narrative review summarizes the evaluation and management of chronic pelvic pain using recommendations from consensus guidelines to facilitate clinical evaluation, treatment, improved care, and more positive patient-clinician interactions.",,,"Lamvu, G (corresponding author), Corresponding Author, Georgine Lamvu, MD USA.",georginelamvu@gmail.com,"Carrillo, Jorge/AAW-4499-2021","Carrillo, Jorge/0000-0001-9481-4117",,,,,67,10,10,4,14,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Data Extraction and SynthesisDual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality. Meta-analysis of screening test accuracy studies. Main Outcomes and MeasuresQuality of life and function, other health and social outcomes, test accuracy, and harms. ResultsForty-one studies (N=26386) were included, 18 of which were new since the previous review. One trial enrolling US veterans (n=2305) assessed the benefits of screening; there was no significant difference in the proportion of participants experiencing a minimum clinically important difference in hearing-related function at 1 year (36%-40% in the screened groups vs 36% in the nonscreened group). Thirty-four studies (n=23228) evaluated test accuracy. For detecting mild hearing loss (>20-25 dB), single-question screening had a pooled sensitivity of 66% (95% CI, 58%-73%) and a pooled specificity of 76% (95% CI, 68%-83%) (10 studies, n=12637); for detecting moderate hearing loss (>35-40 dB), pooled sensitivity was 80% (95% CI, 68%-88%) and pooled specificity was 74% (95% CI, 59%-85%) (6 studies, n=8774). In 5 studies (n=2820) on the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly-Screening to detect moderate hearing loss (>40 dB), pooled sensitivity was 68% (95% CI, 52%-81%) and pooled specificity was 78% (95% CI, 67%-86%). Six trials (n=853) evaluated amplification vs control in populations with screen-detected or recently detected hearing loss over 6 weeks to 4 months. Five measured hearing-related function via the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly; only 3 that enrolled veterans (n=684) found a significant difference considered to represent a minimal important difference (>18.7 points). Few trials reported on other eligible outcomes, and no studies reported on harms of screening or interventions. Conclusions and RelevanceSeveral screening tests can adequately detect hearing loss in older adults; no studies reported on the harms of screening or treatment. Evidence showing benefit from hearing aids on hearing-related function among adults with screen-detected or newly detected hearing loss is limited to studies enrolling veterans.

METHOTREXATE; EFFICACY; SAFETY; MODERATE; RISK,"This narrative review summarizes current evidence regarding the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatments of plaque psoriasis. Importance Approximately 125 million people worldwide have psoriasis. Patients with psoriasis experience substantial morbidity and increased rates of inflammatory arthritis, cardiometabolic diseases, and mental health disorders. Observations Plaque psoriasis is the most common variant of psoriasis. The most rapid advancements addressing plaque psoriasis have been in its pathogenesis, genetics, comorbidities, and biologic treatments. Plaque psoriasis is associated with a number of comorbidities including psoriatic arthritis, cardiometabolic diseases, and depression. For patients with mild psoriasis, topical agents remain the mainstay of treatment, and they include topical corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, calcineurin inhibitors, and keratolytics. The American Academy of Dermatology-National Psoriasis Foundation guidelines recommend biologics as an option for first-line treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis because of their efficacy in treating it and acceptable safety profiles. Specifically, inhibitors to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) include etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab, and infliximab. Other biologics inhibit cytokines such as the p40 subunit of the cytokines IL-12 and IL-13 (ustekinumab), IL-17 (secukinumab, ixekizumab, bimekizumab, and brodalumab), and the p19 subunit of IL-23 (guselkumab, tildrakizumab, risankizumab, and mirikizumab). Biologics that inhibit TNF-alpha, p40IL-12/23, and IL-17 are also approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. Oral treatments include traditional agents such as methotrexate, acitretin, cyclosporine, and the advanced small molecule apremilast, which is a phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor. The most commonly prescribed light therapy used to treat plaque psoriasis is narrowband UV-B phototherapy. Conclusions and Relevance Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease that is associated with multiple comorbidities and substantially diminishes patients' quality of life. Topical therapies remain the cornerstone for treating mild psoriasis. Therapeutic advancements for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis include biologics that inhibit TNF-alpha, p40IL-12/23, IL-17, and p19IL-23, as well as an oral phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor.","[Armstrong, April W.; Read, Charlotte] Univ Southern Calif Los Angeles, Dept Dermatol, Keck Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Read, Charlotte] Imperial Coll London, Dept Med, London, England",,"Armstrong, AW (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, 1975 Zonal Ave,KAM 510,MC 9034, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",aprilarmstrong@post.harvard.edu,,,,,,,94,267,281,52,137,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

We aim to guide clinicians and researchers to consider sex and gender in their approach to diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases as a necessary and fundamental step towards precision medicine, which will benefit men's and women's health.","[Mauvais-Jarvis, Franck] Tulane Univ, Sch Med, Diabet Discovery & Sex Based Med Lab, Sect Endocrinol,John W Deming Dept Med, 1430 Tulane Ave, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA; [Mauvais-Jarvis, Franck] Southeast Louisiana Vet Hlth Care Syst Med Ctr, New Orleans, LA USA; [Merz, Noel Bairey] Cedars Sinai Smidt Heart Inst, Barbra Streisand Womens Heart Ctr, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Barnes, Peter J.] Imperial Coll London, Natl Heart & Lung Inst, London, England; [Brinton, Roberta D.] Univ Arizona, Coll Med, Dept Pharmacol, Ctr Innovat Brain Sci, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; [Brinton, Roberta D.] Univ Arizona, Coll Med, Dept Neurol, Ctr Innovat Brain Sci, Tucson, AZ USA; [Carrero, Juan-Jesus] Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Epidemiol & Biostat, Stockholm, Sweden; [Carrero, Juan-Jesus] Karolinska Inst, Ctr Gender Med, Stockholm, Sweden; [DeMeo, Dawn L.] Harvard Med Sch, Channing Div Network Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [DeMeo, Dawn L.] Harvard Med Sch, Div Pulm & Crit Care Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [De Vries, Geert J.] Georgia State Univ, Neurosci Inst, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [De Vries, Geert J.] Georgia State Univ, Dept Biol, Atlanta, GA USA; [Epperson, C.

Although rates of suicide are higher in male than in female individuals, self-harm is more common in female individuals. Rather than having a single cause, suicide and selfharm are the result of a complex interplay of several factors that occur throughout the life course, and vary by gender, age, ethnicity, and geography. Several clinical and public health interventions show promise, although our understanding of their effectiveness has largely originated from high-income countries. Attempting to predict suicide is unlikely to be helpful. Intervention and prevention must include both a clinical and community focus, and every health professional has a crucial part to play.","[Knipe, Duleeka; Padmanathan, Prianka] Univ Bristol, Bristol Med Sch, Populat Hlth Sci, Canynge Hall, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England; [Knipe, Duleeka] Univ Peradeniya, South Asian Clin Toxicol Res Collaborat, Fac Med, Kandy, Sri Lanka; [Newton-Howes, Giles] Univ Otago, Wellington, New Zealand; [Chan, Lai Fong] Natl Univ Malaysia, Dept Psychiat, Fac Med, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Kapur, Nav] Univ Manchester, Acad Hlth Sci Ctr, Ctr Mental Hlth & Safety, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Kapur, Nav] Univ Manchester, Acad Hlth Sci Ctr, Natl Inst Hlth Res, Greater Manchester Patient Safety Translat Res Ct, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Kapur, Nav] Greater Manchester Mental Hlth Natl Hlth Serv Fdn, Manchester, Lancs, England",,"Knipe, D (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Bristol Med Sch, Populat Hlth Sci, Canynge Hall, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England.",dee.knipe@bristol.ac.uk,,"Knipe, Duleeka/0000-0002-1040-7635; Padmanathan, Prianka/0000-0003-1292-6575",,,,,142,0,0,6,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,MAY 14,2022,399,10338,,,,,1903,1916,,10.1016/S0140-6736(22)00173-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(22)00173-8,,,14,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,1V8AR,35512727,,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000806306700021,View Full Record in Web of Science,18047,1,96,59,100,87,128,26,12,32,70,97,79,119,130,89,102

OBJECTIVE To review the benefits and harms of aspirin in primary cardiovascular disease prevention and colorectal cancer prevention to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through January 2021; literature surveillance through January 21, 2022. STUDY SELECTION English-language randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of low-dose aspirin (<= 100 mg/d) compared with placebo or no intervention in primary prevention populations. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Single extraction, verified by a second reviewer. Quantitative synthesis using Peto fixed-effects meta-analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cardiovascular disease events and mortality, all-cause mortality, colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, major bleeding, and hemorrhagic stroke. RESULTS Eleven RCTs (N = 134 470) and 1 pilot trial (N = 400) of low-dose aspirin for primary cardiovascular disease prevention were included. Low-dose aspirin was associated with a significant decrease in major cardiovascular disease events (odds ratio [OR], 0.90 [95% CI, 0.85-0.95]; 11 RCTs [n = 134 470]; I-2 = 0%; range in absolute effects, -2.5% to 0.1%). Results for individual cardiovascular disease outcomes were significant, with similar magnitude of benefit. Aspirin was not significantly associated with reductions in cardiovascular disease mortality or all-cause mortality. There was limited trial evidence on benefits for colorectal cancer, with the findings highly variable by length of follow-up and statistically significant only when considering long-term observational follow-up beyond randomized trial periods. Low-dose aspirin was associated with significant increases in total major bleeding (OR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.32-1.57]; 10 RCTs [n = 133 194]; I-2 = 4.7%; range in absolute effects, 0.1% to 1.0%) and in site-specific bleeding, with similar magnitude. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Low-dose aspirin was associated with small absolute risk reductions in major cardiovascular disease events and small absolute increases in major bleeding. Colorectal cancer results were less robust and highly variable.","[Guirguis-Blake, Janelle M.; Evans, Corinne, V; Perdue, Leslie A.; Bean, Sarah, I; Senger, Caitlyn A.] Kaiser Permanente, Ctr Hlth Res, Kaiser Permanente Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Portland, OR USA; [Guirguis-Blake, Janelle M.] Univ Washington, Dept Family Med, Tacoma, WA 98405 USA",,"Guirguis-Blake, JM (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Family Med, Kaiser Permanente Evidence Based Practice Ctr, 521 Martin Luther King Jr Way, Tacoma, WA 98405 USA.",jguirgui@u.washington.edu,,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HSA-290-2015-00007-I-EPC5]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HSA-290-2015-00007-I-EPC5, Task Order 9, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).",,120,7,6,2,2,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

OBJECTIVE To develop the STROBE-MR Statement as a stand-alone extension to the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guideline for the reporting of MR studies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The development of the STROBE-MR Statement followed the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) framework guidance and used the STROBE Statement as a starting point to draft a checklist tailored to MR studies. The project was initiated in 2018 by reviewing the literature on the reporting of instrumental variable and MR studies. A group of 17 experts, including MR methodologists, MR study design users, developers of previous reporting guidelines, and journal editors, participated in a workshop in May 2019 to define the scope of the Statement and draft the checklist. The draft checklist was published as a preprint in July 2019 and discussed on the preprint platform, in social media, and at the 4th Mendelian Randomization Conference. The checklist was then revised based on comments, further refined through 2020, and finalized in July 2021. FINDINGS The STROBE-MR checklist is organized into 6 sections (Title and Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, and Other Information) and includes 20 main items and 30 subitems. It covers both 1-sample and 2-sample MR studies that assess 1 or multiple exposures and outcomes, and addresses MR studies that follow a genome-wide association study and are reported in the same article. The checklist asks authors to justify why MR is a helpful method to address the study question and state prespecified causal hypotheses. The measurement, quality, and selection of genetic variants must be described and attempts to assess validity of MR-specific assumptions should be well reported. An item on data sharing includes reporting when the data and statistical code required to replicate the analyses can be accessed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE STROBE-MR provides guidelines for reporting MR studies. Improved reporting of these studies could facilitate their evaluation by editors, peer reviewers, researchers, clinicians, and other readers, and enhance the interpretation of their results.","[Skrivankova, Veronika W.; Egger, Matthias] Univ Bern, Inst Social & Prevent Med, Bern, Switzerland; [Richmond, Rebecca C.; Woolf, Benjamin A.

We compared monotherapy with a P2Y 12 inhibitor versus aspirin for secondary prevention. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, all randomised trials comparing P2Y 12 inhibitor with aspirin monotherapy for secondary prevention in patients with cerebrovascular, coronary, or peripheral artery disease were evaluated for inclusion. On Dec 18, 2019, we searched PubMed, Embase, BioMedCentral, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Additionally, we reviewed references from identified articles and searched abstracts from 2017 to 2019 presented at relevant scientific meetings. Data about year of publication, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, baseline patients' features including the baseline condition determining study inclusion (ie, cerebrovascular, coronary, or peripheral artery disease), P2Y 12 inhibitor type and dosage, aspirin dosage, endpoint definitions, effect estimates, follow-up duration, and percentage of patients lost to follow-up were collected. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were used as metric of choice for treatment effects with random-effects models. Co-primary endpoints were myocardial infarction and stroke. Key secondary endpoints were all-cause death and vascular death. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I-2 index. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018115037). Findings A total of nine randomised trials were identified and included in this study, and 42 108 patients randomly allocated to a P2Y 12 inhibitor (n=21 043) or aspirin (n=21 065) were included in our analyses. Patients who received a P2Y 12 inhibitor had a borderline reduction for the risk of myocardial infarction compared with those who received aspirin (OR 0 center dot 81 [95% CI 0 center dot 66-0 center dot 99]; I-2=10 center dot 9%). Risks of stroke (OR 0 center dot 93 [0 center dot 82-1 center dot 06]; I-2=34 center dot 5%), all-cause death (OR 0 center dot 98 [0 center dot 89-1 center dot 08]; I-2=0%), and vascular death (OR 0 center dot 97 [0 center dot 86-1 center dot 09]; I-2=0%) did not differ between patients who received a P2Y 12 inhibitor and those who received aspirin. Similarly, the risk of major bleeding (OR 0 center dot 90 [0 center dot 74-1 center dot 10]; I-2=3 center dot 9%) did not differ between patients who received a P2Y 12 inhibitor and those who received aspirin. The number needed to treat to prevent one myocardial infarction with P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy was 244 patients. Findings were consistent regardless of the type of P2Y 12 inhibitor used. Interpretation Compared with aspirin monotherapy, P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy is associated with a risk reduction for myocardial infarction and a comparable risk of stroke in the setting of secondary prevention. The benefit of P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy is of debatable clinical relevance, in view of the high number needed to treat to prevent a myocardial infarction and the absence of any effect on all-cause and vascular mortality.

A 2012 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found antiretroviral therapy (ART) associated with improved clinical outcomes and decreased transmission risk in persons with CD4 cell counts less than 500/mm(3). OBJECTIVE To update the 2012 review on HIV screening to inform the USPSTF. DATA SOURCES Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2012 to June 2018, with surveillance through January 2019. STUDY SELECTION Nonpregnant individuals 12 years and older; randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and controlled observational studies of screening vs no screening, alternative screening strategies, earlier vs later initiation of ART, and long-term harms of ART. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS One investigator abstracted data; a second checked accuracy. Two investigators independently rated study quality. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mortality, AIDS events, quality of life, function, and HIV transmission; harms of screening and long-term (>= 2 years) harms of ART; screening yield. RESULTS Eighteen new studies (5 RCTs, 11 cohort studies, and 2 systematic reviews; N = 266 563) were included, and 11 studies (2 RCTs and 9 cohort studies; N = 218 542) were carried forward from the prior USPSTF report. No study directly evaluated effects of HIV screening vs no screening on clinical outcomes or harms, or the yield of alternative screening strategies. Two newly identified RCTs conducted completely or partially in low-resource settings found ART initiation at CD4 cell counts greater than 500/mm(3) associated with lower risk of a composite outcome of mortality, AIDS-defining events, or serious non-AIDS events (relative risk [RR], 0.44 [95% CI, 0.31-0.63] and RR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.35-0.95]); results were consistent with those from a large observational study. Early ART was not associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events. Early ART initiation was associated with sustained reduction in risk of HIV transmission at 5.5 years (RR, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.02-0.22] for linked transmission). New evidence regarding the association between abacavir use and risk of cardiovascular events was inconsistent. Certain antiretroviral regimens were associated with increased risk of long-term neuropsychiatric, renal, hepatic, and bone adverse events. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In nonpregnant adolescents and adults there was no direct evidence on the clinical benefits and harms of screening for HIV infections vs no screening, or the yield of repeat or alternative screening strategies. New evidence extends effectiveness of ART to asymptomatic individuals with CD4 cell counts greater than 500/mm(3) and shows sustained reduction in risk of HIV transmission at longer-term follow-up, although certain ART regimens may be associated with increased risk of long-term harms.","[Chou, Roger; Dana, Tracy; Grusing, Sara; Bougatsos, Christina] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Med Informat & Clin Epidemiol, Pacific Northwest Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Chou, Roger] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Div Gen Internal Med & Geriatr, Portland, OR 97239 USA",,"Chou, R (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, 3181 SWSam Jackson Pk Rd,Mail Code BICC, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",chour@ohsu.edu,,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA290201500009i]; USPSTF","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services; USPSTF","This research was funded under contract HHSA290201500009i, Task Order 7, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the USPSTF.",,60,17,18,0,0,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Most are treated nonoperatively. Approximately 600 000 surgical procedures are performed in the US each year for lumbar spinal stenosis. OBSERVATIONS The prevalence of the clinical syndrome of lumbar spinal stenosis in US adults is approximately 11% and increases with age. The diagnosis can generally be made based on a clinical history of back and lower extremity pain that is provoked by lumbar extension, relieved by lumbar flexion, and confirmed with cross-sectional imaging, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Nonoperative treatment includes activity modification such as reducing periods of standing or walking, oral medications to diminish pain such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and physical therapy. In a series of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis followed up for up to 3 years without operative intervention, approximately one-third of patients reported improvement, approximately 50% reported no change in symptoms, and approximately 10% to 20% of patients reported that their back pain, leg pain, and walking were worse. Long-term benefits of epidural steroid injections for lumbar spinal stenosis have not been demonstrated. Surgery appears effective in carefully selected patients with back, buttock, and lower extremity pain who do not improve with conservative management. For example, in a randomized trial of 94 participants with symptomatic and radiographic degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis, decompressive laminectomy improved symptoms more than nonoperative therapy (difference, 7.8 points; 95% CI, 0.8-14.9; minimum clinically important difference, 10-12.8) on the Oswestry Disability Index (score range, 0-100). Among persons with lumbar spinal stenosis and concomitant spondylolisthesis, lumbar fusion increased symptom resolution in 1 trial (difference, 5.7 points; 95% CI, 0.1 to 11.3) on the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical dimension score (range, 0-100), but 2 other trials showed either no important differences between the 2 therapies or noninferiority of lumbar decompression alone compared with lumbar decompression plus spinal fusion (MCID, 2-4.9 points). In a noninferiority trial, 71.4% treated with lumbar decompression alone vs 72.9% of those receiving decompression plus fusion achieved a 30% or more reduction in Oswestry Disability Index score, consistent with the prespecified noninferiority hypothesis. Fusion is associated with greater risk of complications such as blood loss, infection, longer hospital stays, and higher costs. Thus, the precise indications for concomitant lumbar fusion in persons with lumbar spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis remain unclear. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Lumbar spinal stenosis affects approximately 103 million people worldwide and 11% of older adults in the US. First-line therapy is activity modification, analgesia, and physical therapy. Long-term benefits from epidural steroid injections have not been established. Selected patients with continued pain and activity limitation may be candidates for decompressive surgery.","[Katz, Jeffrey N.; Zimmerman, Zoe E.; Mass, Hanna] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Orthoped & Arthrit Ctr Outcomes Res, 75 Francis St,Hale 5016, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Katz, Jeffrey N.; Zimmerman, Zoe E.; Mass, Hanna; Makhni, Melvin C.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Orthoped Surg, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Katz, Jeffrey N.; Makhni, Melvin C.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Katz, Jeffrey N.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Boston, MA USA",,"Katz, JN (corresponding author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Orthoped & Arthrit Ctr Outcomes Res, 75 Francis St,Hale 5016, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",jnkatz@bwh.harvard.edu,,,,,,,67,0,0,3,3,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether baseline LDL-C level is associated with total and cardiovascular mortality risk reductions. DATA SOURCESAND STUDY SELECTION Electronic databases (Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, TCTMD, ClinicalTrials.gov, major congress proceedings) were searched through February 2, 2018, to identify randomized clinical trials of statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9-inhibiting monoclonal antibodies. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two investigators abstracted data and appraised risks of bias. Intervention groups were categorized as more intensive (more potent pharmacologic intervention) or less intensive (less potent, placebo, or control group). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The coprimary end points were total mortality and cardiovascular mortality. Random-effects meta-regression and meta-analyses evaluated associations between baseline LDL-C level and reductions in mortality end points and secondary end points including major adverse cardiac events (MACE). RESULTS In 34 trials, 136 299 patients received more intensive and 133 989 received less intensive LDL-C lowering. All-cause mortality was lower for more vs less intensive therapy (7.08% vs 7.70%; rate ratio [RR], 0.92 [95% CI, 0.88 to 0.96]), but varied by baseline LDL-C level. Meta-regression showed more intensive LDL-C lowering was associated with greater reductions in all-cause mortality with higher baseline LDL-C levels (change in RRs per 40-mg/dL increase in baseline LDL-C, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.86 to 0.96]; P=.001; absolute risk difference [ARD], -1.05 incident cases per 1000 person-years [95% CI, -1.59 to -0.51]), but only when baseline LDL-C levelswere 100mg/dL or greater (P <.001 for interaction) in ameta-analysis. Cardiovascular mortalitywas lower for more vs less intensive therapy (3.48% vs 4.07%; RR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.79 to 0.89]) but varied by baseline LDL-C level. Meta-regression showed more intensive LDL-C lowering was associated with a greater reduction in cardiovascular mortality with higher baseline LDL-C levels (change in RRs per 40-mg/dL increase in baseline LDL-C, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.80 to 0.94]; P<.001; ARD, -1.0 incident cases per 1000 person-years [95% CI, -1.51 to -0.45]), but only when baseline LDL-C levelswere 100mg/dL or greater (P <.001 for interaction) in ameta-analysis. Trials with baseline LDL-C levels of 160mg/dL or greater had the greatest reduction in all-cause mortality (RR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.84]; P<.001; 4.3 fewer deaths per 1000 person-years) in ameta-analysis. More intensive LDL-C lowering was also associated with progressively greater risk reductions with higher baseline LDL-C level for myocardial infarction, revascularization, and MACE. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In these meta-analyses and meta-regressions, more intensive compared with less intensive LDL-C lowering was associated with a greater reduction in risk of total and cardiovascular mortality in trials of patients with higher baseline LDL-C levels. This association was not present when baseline LDL-C level was less than 100mg/dL, suggesting that the greatest benefit from LDL-C-lowering therapy may occur for patients with higher baseline LDL-C levels.","[Navarese, Eliano P.; Bliden, Kevin; Tantry, Udaya; Gurbel, Paul A.] Inova Heart & Vasc Inst, Inova Ctr Thrombosis Res & Drug Dev, Intervent Cardiol & Cardiovasc Med Res, Falls Church, VA USA; [Navarese, Eliano P.; Kowalewski, Mariusz; Kolodziejczak, Michalina; Andreotti, Felicita; Gurbel, Paul A.] Systemat Invest & Res Intervent & Outcomes SIRIO, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Navarese, Eliano P.; Kolodziejczak, Michalina; Kubica, Jacek] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Ludwik Rydygier Coll Med, Cardiovasc Inst, Bydgoszcz, Poland; [Robinson, Jennifer G.] Univ Iowa, Dept Epidemiol, Prevent Intervent Ctr, Iowa City, IA USA; [Robinson, Jennifer G.] Univ Iowa, Dept Med, Prevent Intervent Ctr, Iowa City, IA USA; [Kowalewski, Mariusz] Dr Antoni Jurasz Mem Univ Hosp, Cardiovasc Inst, Dept Cardiac Surg, Bydgoszcz, Poland; [Andreotti, Felicita] Catholic Univ, Med Sch, Inst Cardiol, Rome, Italy; [Raggi, Paolo] Univ Alberta, Mazankowski Alberta Heart Inst, Edmonton, AB, Canada",,"Robinson, JG (corresponding author), Prevent Intervent Ctr, Dept Epidemiol, 145 N Riverside Dr,5455 CPHB, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.;Robinson, JG (corresponding author), Prevent Intervent Ctr, Prevent Med, 145 N Riverside Dr,5455 CPHB, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",jennifer-g-robinson@uima.edu,"Kubica, Jacek/D-6906-2014; , Jennifer/AAD-8336-2019; Kowalewski, Mariusz/AAA-6845-2020; Andreotti, Felicita/A-9962-2019; Kołodziejczak, Michalina/AAL-3968-2020","Kubica, Jacek/0000-0001-8250-754X; Andreotti, Felicita/0000-0002-1456-6430; Kołodziejczak, Michalina/0000-0001-5969-6055; Navarese, Eliano/0000-0002-2355-4589",Amgen; Sanofi; Acasti; Amarin; AstraZeneca; Esai; Esperion; Merck; Pfizer; Regeneron; Takeda; Akcea/Ioinis; Dr Reddy Laboratories; Eli Lilly; Actelion; Bayer; Boehringer-Ingelheim; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Daiichi Sankyo; Menarini International Foundation; Medicure,Amgen(Amgen); Sanofi; Acasti; Amarin; AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca); Esai; Esperion; Merck(Merck & Company); Pfizer(Pfizer); Regeneron(Regeneron); Takeda(Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd); Akcea/Ioinis; Dr Reddy Laboratories; Eli Lilly(Eli Lilly); Actelion; Bayer(Bayer AG); Boehringer-Ingelheim(Boehringer Ingelheim); Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb); Daiichi Sankyo(Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited); Menarini International Foundation(Menarini Group); Medicure,"All authors have completed and submitted the ICMJE Form for Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest.

According to large US cohort studies, estimated lifetime prevalences for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder in adult women are 1.42%, 0.46%, and 1.25%, respectively, and are lower in adult men (anorexia nervosa, 0.12%; bulimia nervosa, 0.08%; binge eating disorder, 0.42%). Eating disorder prevalence ranges from 0.3% to 2.3% in adolescent females and 0.3% to 1.3% in adolescent males. Eating disorders are associated with short-term and long-term adverse health outcomes, including physical, psychological, and social problems. OBJECTIVE The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for eating disorders in adolescents and adults with a normal or high body mass index. Evidence limited to populations who are underweight or have other physical signs or symptoms of eating disorders was not considered. The USPSTF has not previously made a recommendation on this topic. POPULATION Adolescents and adults (10 years or older) who have no signs or symptoms of eating disorders (eg, rapid weight loss, weight gain, or pronounced deviation from growth trajectory; pubertal delay; bradycardia; oligomenorrhea; and amenorrhea). EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for eating disorders in adolescents and adults. The evidence is limited and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for eating disorders in adolescents and adults.","[Davidson, Karina W.] Northwell Hlth, Feinstein Inst Med Res, Manhasset, NY USA; [Barry, Michael J.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Mangione, Carol M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Cabana, Michael] Albert Einstein Coll Med, New York, NY USA; [Chelmow, David] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, VA USA; [Coker, Tumaini Rucker] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Davis, Esa M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Donahue, Katrina E.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Jaen, Carlos Roberto] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA; [Kubik, Martha] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Li, Li] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Ogedegbe, Gbenga] NYU, New York, NY USA; [Pbert, Lori] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Worcester, MA USA; [Ruiz, John M.] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ USA; [Silverstein, Michael] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Stevermer, James] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO USA; [Wong, John B.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02111 USA",,"Davidson, KW (corresponding author), Feinstein Inst Med Res, 130 E 59th St,Ste 14C, New York, NY 10032 USA.",chair@uspstf.net,,,Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ),Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality),"The USPSTF is an independent, voluntary body.

AKI occurs in approximately 10-15% of patients admitted to hospital, while its incidence in intensive care has been reported in more than 50% of patients. Kidney dysfunction or damage can occur over a longer period or follow AKI in a continuum with acute and chronic kidney disease. Biomarkers of kidney injury or stress are new tools for risk assessment and could possibly guide therapy. AKI is not a single disease but rather a loose collection of syndromes as diverse as sepsis, cardiorenal syndrome, and urinary tract obstruction. The approach to a patient with AKI depends on the clinical context and can also vary by resource availability. Although the effectiveness of several widely applied treatments is still controversial, evidence for several interventions, especially when used together, has increased over the past decade.","[Ronco, Claudio] Univ Padua, Dept Med, Padua, Italy; [Ronco, Claudio] Int Renal Res Inst Vicenza, Vicenza, Italy; [Ronco, Claudio] San Bortolo Hosp, Dept Nephrol, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy; [Bellomo, Rinaldo] Austin Hosp, Crit Care Dept, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Kellum, John A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Crit Care Nephrol, Dept Crit Care Med, Pittsburgh, PA USA",,"Ronco, C (corresponding author), San Bortolo Hosp, Dept Nephrol, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy.",cronco@goldnet.it,"Camussi, Giovanni/J-7624-2016; Kellum, John/AAP-3072-2020","Camussi, Giovanni/0000-0003-2795-232X; Kellum, John/0000-0003-1995-2653; Ronco, Claudio/0000-0002-6697-4065",,,,,183,400,429,33,136,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,NOV 23,2019,394,10212,,,,,1949,1964,,10.1016/S0140-6736(19)32563-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(19)32563-2,,,16,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,JQ3SI,31777389,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000498868500029,View Full Record in Web of Science,19375,1,154,55,75,154,155,95,55,132,148,158,57,7,6,147,102

There are three major methods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection and their role has evolved during the course of the pandemic. Molecular tests such as PCR are highly sensitive and specific at detecting viral RNA, and are recommended by WHO for confirming diagnosis in individuals who are symptomatic and for activating public health measures. Antigen rapid detection tests detect viral proteins and, although they are less sensitive than molecular tests, have the advantages of being easier to do, giving a faster time to result, of being lower cost, and able to detect infection in those who are most likely to be at risk of transmitting the virus to others. Antigen rapid detection tests can be used as a public health tool for screening individuals at enhanced risk of infection, to protect people who are clinically vulnerable, to ensure safe travel and the resumption of schooling and social activities, and to enable economic recovery. With vaccine roll-out, antibody tests (which detect the host's response to infection or vaccination) can be useful surveillance tools to inform public policy, but should not be used to provide proof of immunity, as the correlates of protection remain unclear. All three types of COVID-19 test continue to have a crucial role in the transition from pandemic response to pandemic control.","[Peeling, Rosanna W.; Heymann, David L.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Clin Res Dept, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Peeling, Rosanna W.] Univ Manitoba, Med Microbiol Dept, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Teo, Yik-Ying] Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, Singapore, Singapore; [Garcia, Patricia J.] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Sch Publ Hlth, Lima, Peru; [Garcia, Patricia J.] Univ Washington, Dept Global Hlth, Seattle, WA USA",,"Peeling, RW (corresponding author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Clin Res Dept, London WC1E 7HT, England.",rosanna.peeling@lshtm.ac.uk,,,,,,,104,16,16,24,25,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,FEB,2022,399,10326,,,,,757,768,,10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02346-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02346-1,,,12,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,ZE3NS,34942102,Green Published,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000758794200023,View Full Record in Web of Science,19390,1,7,48,87,79,32,44,18,7,2,15,45,30,53,77,16

It occurs commonly as an age-related process in older people, influenced not only by contemporaneous risk factors, but also by genetic and lifestyle factors operating across the life course. It can also occur in mid-life in association with a range of conditions. Sarcopenia has become the focus of intense research aiming to translate current knowledge about its pathophysiology into improved diagnosis and treatment, with particular interest in the development of biomarkers, nutritional interventions, and drugs to augment the beneficial effects of resistance exercise.

Clinicians must make treatment decisions with respect to prophylaxis, surgical management, specific antibiotics, and the length of treatment in the setting of emerging, sometimes inconclusive clinical research findings. OBSERVATIONS Community-associated infective endocarditis remains the predominant form of the disease; however, health care accounts for one-third of cases in high-income countries. As medical interventions are increasingly performed on older patients, the disease incidence from cardiac implanted electronic devices is also increasing. In addition, younger patients involved with intravenous drug use has increased in the past decade and with it the proportion of US hospitalization has increased to more than 10%. These epidemiological factors have led to Staphylococcus aureus being the most common cause in high-income countries, accounting for up to 40% of cases. The mainstays of diagnosis are still echocardiography and blood cultures. Adjunctive imaging such as cardiac computed tomographic and nuclear imaging can improve the sensitivity for diagnosis when echocardiography is not conclusive. Serological studies, histopathology, and polymerase chain reaction assays have distinct roles in the diagnosis of infective endocarditis when blood culture have tested negative with the highest yield obtained from serological studies. Increasing antibiotic resistance, particularly to S aureus, has led to a need for different antibiotic treatment options such as newer antibiotics and combination therapy regimens. Surgery can confer a survival benefit to patients with major complications; however, the decision to pursue surgery must balance the risks and benefits of operations in these frequently high-risk patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The epidemiology and management of infective endocarditis are continually changing. Guidelines provide specific recommendations about management; however, careful attention to individual patient characteristics, pathogen, and risk of sequela must be considered when making therapeutic decisions.","[Wang, Andrew] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Cardiol, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Gaca, Jeffrey G.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Div Cardiovasc & Thorac Surg, Durham, NC 27710 USA; [Chu, Vivian H.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, Durham, NC 27710 USA",,"Chu, VH (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Med Ctr, DUMC Box 102359,Hanes Bldg,Room 177, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",vivian.chu@duke.edu,,"Wang, Andrew/0000-0001-8729-0933",American Heart Association Mid-Atlantic; American College of Physicians; National Institutes of Health; MyoKardia Inc; Abbott Vascular; Gilead Sciences; Theravance; DNAe,American Heart Association Mid-Atlantic(American Heart Association); American College of Physicians; National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); MyoKardia Inc; Abbott Vascular(Abbott Laboratories); Gilead Sciences(Gilead Sciences); Theravance; DNAe,"All authors have completed and submitted the ICMJE Form for Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest.

OBSERVATIONS Contraceptive effectiveness is determined by a combination of drug or device efficacy, individual fecundability, coital frequency, and user adherence and continuation. In the US, oral contraceptive pills are the most commonly used reversible method of contraception and comprise 21.9% of all contraception in current use. Pregnancy rates of women using oral contraceptives are 4% to 7% per year. Use of long-acting methods, such as intrauterine devices and subdermal implants, has increased substantially, from 6% of all contraceptive users in 2008 to 17.8% in 2016; these methods have failure rates of less than 1% per year. Estrogen-containing methods, such as combined oral contraceptive pills, increase the risk of venous thrombosis from 2 to 10 venous thrombotic events per 10 000 women-years to 7 to 10 venous thrombotic events per 10 000 women-years, whereas progestin-only and nonhormonal methods, such as implants and condoms, are associated with rare serious risks. Hormonal contraceptives can improve medical conditions associated with hormonal changes related to the menstrual cycle, such as acne, endometriosis, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Optimal contraceptive selection requires patient and clinician discussion of the patient's tolerance for risk of pregnancy, menstrual bleeding changes, other risks, and personal values and preferences. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Oral contraceptive pills are the most commonly used reversible contraceptives, intrauterine devices and subdermal implants have the highest effectiveness, and progestin-only and nonhormonal methods have the lowest risks. Optimal contraceptive selection incorporates patient values and preferences.","[Teal, Stephanie] Univ Hosp Med Ctr, Dept OB GYN, Portland, ME USA; [Teal, Stephanie] Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH USA; [Edelman, Alison] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept OB GYN, Portland, ME USA",,"Teal, S (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Med Ctr, Dept OB GYN, 11100 Euclid Ave,MAC-5304, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.;Teal, S (corresponding author), Case Western Reserve Univ, 11100 Euclid Ave,MAC-5304, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",Stephanie.Teal@uhhospitals.org,,,,,,,97,5,5,9,10,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

OBJECTIVE To provide updated model-based estimates of the benefits, burden, and harms of colorectal cancer screening strategies and to identify strategies that may provide an efficient balance of life-years gained (LYG) from screening and colonoscopy burden to inform the USPSTF. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Comparative modeling study using 3 microsimulation models of colorectal cancer screening in a hypothetical cohort of 40-year-old US individuals at average risk of colorectal cancer. EXPOSURES Screening from ages 45, 50, or 55 years to ages 70, 75, 80, or 85 years with fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), multitarget stool DNA testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy alone or with FIT, computed tomography colonography, or colonoscopy. All persons with an abnormal noncolonoscopy screening test result were assumed to undergo follow-up colonoscopy. Screening intervals varied by test. Full adherence with all procedures was assumed. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES Estimated LYG relative to no screening (benefit), lifetime number of colonoscopies (burden), number of complications from screening (harms), and balance of incremental burden and benefit (efficiency ratios). Efficient strategies were those estimated to require fewer additional colonoscopies per additional LYG relative to other strategies. RESULTS Estimated LYG from screening strategies ranged from 171 to 381 per 1000 40-year-olds. Lifetime colonoscopy burden ranged from 624 to 6817 per 1000 individuals, and screening complications ranged from 5 to 22 per 1000 individuals. Among the 49 strategies that were efficient options with all 3 models, 41 specified screening beginning at age 45. No single age to end screening was predominant among the efficient strategies, although the additional LYG from continuing screening after age 75 were generally small. With the exception of a 5-year interval for computed tomography colonography, no screening interval predominated among the efficient strategies for each modality. Among the strategies highlighted in the 2016 USPSTF recommendation, lowering the age to begin screening from 50 to 45 years was estimated to result in 22 to 27 additional LYG, 161 to 784 additional colonoscopies, and 0.1 to 2 additional complications per 1000 persons (ranges are across screening strategies, based on mean estimates across models). Assuming full adherence, screening outcomes and efficient strategies were similar by sex and race and across 3 scenarios for population risk of colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This microsimulation modeling analysis suggests that screening for colorectal cancer with stool tests, endoscopic tests, or computed tomography colonography starting at age 45 years provides an efficient balance of colonoscopy burden and life-years gained.","[Knudsen, Amy B.; Lietz, Anna P.; Seguin, Claudia L.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Inst Technol Assessment, 101 Merrimac St,Ste 1010, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Knudsen, Amy B.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Rutter, Carolyn M.] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA USA; [Peterse, Elisabeth F.

It follows on from the work of the 2015 Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change, 2 which concluded that anthropogenic climate change threatens to undermine the past 50 years of gains in public health, and conversely, that a comprehensive response to climate change could be the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century. The Lancet Countdown is a collaboration between 24 academic institutions and intergovernmental organisations based in every continent and with representation from a wide range of disciplines. The collaboration includes climate scientists, ecologists, economists, engineers, experts in energy, food, and transport systems, geographers, mathematicians, social and political scientists, public health professionals, and doctors. It reports annual indicators across five sections: climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerability; adaptation planning and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement. The key messages from the 40 indicators in the Lancet Countdown's 2017 report are summarised below.","[Watts, Nick; Wheeler, Nicola] UCL, Inst Global Hlth, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Chambers, Jonathan;

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) attempts to balance the need for evidence generation with an approval process that facilitates access and encourages innovation. OBJECTIVE To review the development of laws and standards affecting the evaluation and oversight of medical devices by the US regulatory system and the outcomes of this system from 1976 to 2020. EVIDENCE REVIEW Laws enacted by US Congress and regulations promulgated by the FDA through 2020; databases maintained by the FDA of device authorizations from 1976 to 2020; and annual reports of user fees paid to the FDA by industry. FINDINGS Since Congress and the FDA initiated premarket review of medical devices in 1976, some fundamental innovations in the device regulation system have included special pathways to accelerate availability of investigational devices, more flexible evidence and review requirements, and increased funding to the FDA through industry-paid user fees. From 1987 to 2020, the annual number of novel devices granted premarket approval (which excludes supplements) ranged from 8 to 56 (median, 32), and the number of clearances for 510(k) devices (those that are substantially equivalent to marketed devices) ranged from 2804 to 5762 (median, 3404). User fee funding for devices was established in 2002 and annual fees collected increased from $30 million in 2003 (in 2019 dollars) to more than $208 million in 2019; this represented 43% of FDA funding related to the review of medical devices. Although many new devices have led to considerable patient benefit, such as hypodermic needles and magnetic resonance imaging machines, important adverse events caused by some devices, such as an implanted device for birth control and a surgical mesh implant for pelvic organ prolapse, have led to calls to reexamine the regulatory system for such products. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Over the last 45 years, medical device regulation has become more complex, with more regulatory pathways and greater variations in the evidence and controls required for authorization. Increased FDA support from industry and concern about flexible authorization requirements reflect the tension between efficient access and the need for assurances that products will safely benefit patients.","[Darrow, Jonathan J.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Program Regulat Therapeut & Law PORTAL, Div Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmacoecon, 1620 Tremont St,Ste 3030, Boston, MA 02120 USA; [Darrow, Jonathan J.] Harvard Med Sch, 1620 Tremont St,Ste 3030, Boston, MA 02120 USA",,"Darrow, JJ (corresponding author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Program Regulat Therapeut & Law PORTAL, Div Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmacoecon, 1620 Tremont St,Ste 3030, Boston, MA 02120 USA.;Darrow, JJ (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, 1620 Tremont St,Ste 3030, Boston, MA 02120 USA.",jjdarrow@bwh.harvard.edu,,,Arnold Ventures,Arnold Ventures,This study was supported by Arnold Ventures.,,108,4,4,7,16,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

OBJECTIVE To systematically review the evidence on benefits and harms of AAA screening and small aneurysm treatment to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, PubMed (publisher supplied only), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant English-language studies published through September 2018. Surveillance continued through July 2019. STUDY SELECTION Trials of AAA screening benefits and harms; trials and cohort studies of small (3.0-5.4 cm) AAA treatment benefits and harms. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles and extracted data. The Petomethod was used to pool odds ratios (ORs) for AAA-related mortality, rupture, and operations; the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was used to pool calculated risk ratios for all-cause mortality. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES AAA and all-cause mortality; AAA rupture; treatment complications. RESULTS Fifty studies (N = 323 279) met inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of population-based randomized clinical trials (RCTs) estimated that a screening invitation to men 65 years or older was associated with a reduction in AAA-related mortality over 12 to 15 years (OR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.57-0.74]; 4 RCTs [n = 124 926]), AAA-related ruptures over 12 to 15 years (OR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.55-0.70]; 4 RCTs [n = 124 929]), and emergency surgical procedures over 4 to 15 years (OR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.48-0.68]; 5 RCTS [n = 175 085]). In contrast, no significant association with all-cause mortality benefit was seen at 12- to 15-year follow-up (relative risk, 0.99 [95% CI 0.98-1.00]; 4 RCTs [n = 124 929]). One-time screening was associated with significantly more procedures over 4 to 15 years in the invited group compared with the control group (OR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.34-1.55]; 5 RCTs [n = 175 085]). Four trials (n = 3314) of small aneurysm surgical treatment demonstrated no significant difference in AAA-related mortality or all-cause mortality compared with surveillance over 1.7 to 12 years. These 4 early surgery trials showed a substantial increase in procedures in the early surgery group. For small aneurysm treatment, registry data (3 studies [n = 14 424]) showed that women had higher surgical complications and postoperative mortality compared with men. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE One-time AAA screening in men 65 years or older was associated with decreased AAA-related mortality and rupture rates but was not associated with all-cause mortality benefit. Higher rates of elective surgery but no long-term differences in quality of life resulted from screening.","[Guirguis-Blake, Janelle M.] Univ Washington, Dept Family Med, Tacoma, WA USA; [Guirguis-Blake, Janelle M.; Beil, Tracy L.; Senger, Caitlyn A.; Coppola, Erin L.] Kaiser Permanente Ctr Hlth Res, Kaiser Permanente Res Affiliates Evidence Based P, Portland, OR USA",,"Guirguis-Blake, JM (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Family Med, Kaiser Permanente Res Affiliates Evidence Based P, 521 Martin Luther King Jr Way, Tacoma, WA 98405 USA.",jguirgui@u.washington.edu,,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA290201500007I]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA290201500007I, Task Order 3, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).",,119,49,54,1,2,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

From 1960 to 2001, the centralised health system of Indonesia made gains as medical care infrastructure grew from virtually no primary health centres to 20 900 centres. Life expectancy improved from 48 to 69 years, infant mortality decreased from 76 deaths per 1000 livebirths to 23 per 1000, and the total fertility rate decreased from 5.61 to 2.11. However, gains across the country were starkly uneven with major health gaps, such as the stagnant maternal mortality of around 300 deaths per 100 000 livebirths, and minimal change in neonatal mortality. The centralised one size fits all approach did not address the complexity and diversity in population density and dispersion across islands, diets, diseases, local living styles, health beliefs, human development, and community participation. Decentralisation of governance to 354 districts in 2001, and currently 514 districts, further increased health system heterogeneity and exacerbated equity gaps. The novel UHC system introduced in 2014 focused on accommodating diversity with flexible and adaptive implementation features and quick evidence-driven decisions based on changing needs. The UHC system grew rapidly and covers 203 million people, the largest single-payer scheme in the world, and has improved health equity and service access. With early success, challenges have emerged, such as the so-called missing-middle group, a term used to designate the smaller number of people who have enrolled in UHC in wealth quintiles Q2-Q3 than in other quintiles, and the low UHC coverage of children from birth to age 4 years. Moreover, high costs for non-communicable diseases warrant new features for prevention and promotion of healthy lifestyles, and investment in a robust integrated digital health-information system for front-line health workers is crucial for impact and sustainability. This Review describes the innovative UHC initiative of Indonesia along with the future roadmap required to meet sustainable development goals by 2030.","[Agustina, Rina] Univ Indonesia, Dr Cipto Mangunkusumo Gen Hosp, Fac Med, Dept Nutr, Jakarta 10430, Indonesia; [Agustina, Rina; Achadi, Endang L.; Wirawan, Fadila; Shankar, Anuraj H.] Univ Indonesia, Fac Med, Nutr Res Ctr, Indonesian Med Educ & Res Inst, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Dartanto, Teguh] Univ Indonesia, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Depok, Indonesia; [Dartanto, Teguh] Univ Indonesia, Fac Econ & Business, Inst Econ & Social Res LPEM, Depok, Indonesia; [Sitompul, Ratna] Univ Indonesia, Dr Cipto Mangunkusumo Gen Hosp, Fac Med, Dept Ophthalmol, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Susiloretni, Kun A.] Minist Hlth, Semarang Hlth Polytech, Dept Nutr, Semarang, Indonesia; [Suparmi] Minist Hlth, Natl Inst Hlth Res & Dev, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Achadi, Endang L.] Univ Indonesia, Fac Publ Hlth, Dept Nutr, Depok, Indonesia; [Taher, Akmal] Minist Hlth, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Taher, Akmal] Univ Indonesia, Dr Cipto Mangunkusumo Gen Hosp, Fac Med, Dept Urol, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Sungkar, Saleha] Univ Indonesia, Fac Med, Dept Parasitol, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Sudarmono, Pratiwi] Univ Indonesia, Dr Cipto Mangunkusumo Gen Hosp, Fac Med, Dept Microbiol, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Shankar, Anuraj H.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Nutr, Boston, MA USA; [Thabrany, Hasbullah] Natl Social Secur Council, Depok, Indonesia; [Thabrany, Hasbullah] Univ Indonesia, Dept Hlth Policy & Adm, Depok, Indonesia",,"Agustina, R (corresponding author), Univ Indonesia, Dr Cipto Mangunkusumo Gen Hosp, Fac Med, Dept Nutr, Jakarta 10430, Indonesia.",r.agustina@ui.ac.id,"Susiloretni, Kun A/M-6770-2014; Agustina, Rina/ACB-0823-2022; Agustina, Rina/GLU-2061-2022; Khusun, Helda/AAC-2183-2021; Suparmi, Suparmi/AAD-9517-2020","Susiloretni, Kun A/0000-0002-9858-4336; Agustina, Rina/0000-0002-8464-1037; Khusun, Helda/0000-0002-3093-0175; Suparmi, Suparmi/0000-0002-1319-0961; Dartanto, Teguh/0000-0002-1737-3650; Wirawan, Fadila/0000-0003-1621-1470; Sari, Okky/0000-0001-8347-6984",Human Nutrition Research Centre; Indonesian Medical Education and Research Institute; Centre for Strategic and International Studies; PITTA grant award from the Directorate Research and Community Services (Universitas Indonesia); Universitas Indonesia RESOLV programme; Office of the Faculty of Medicine (Universitas Indonesia); MRC [MR/P013996/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Human Nutrition Research Centre; Indonesian Medical Education and Research Institute; Centre for Strategic and International Studies; PITTA grant award from the Directorate Research and Community Services (Universitas Indonesia); Universitas Indonesia RESOLV programme; Office of the Faculty of Medicine (Universitas Indonesia); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"We thank Tikki Elka Pangestu, Mari Elka Pangestu, Diah Saminarsih, Frans J Kok, Amin Subandrio, Viktoria Rabovskaja, Meiwita Budiharsana, Maya Amiarny Rusady, Yulita Hendrartini, Nurul Dina Rahmawati, Abdillah Ahsan, Achmad Fauzi Kamal, Feni Tunarsih, and Annisa Permata Sutan for their insights and support in drafting this report.

According to the 2011-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, approximately 23% of children aged 2 to 5 years had dental caries in their primary teeth. Prevalence is higher in Mexican American children (33%) and non-Hispanic Black children (28%) than in non-Hispanic White children (18%). Dental caries in early childhood is associated with pain, loss of teeth, impaired growth, decreased weight gain, negative effects on quality of life, poor school performance, and future dental caries. OBJECTIVE To update its 2014 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on screening and interventions to prevent dental caries in children younger than 5 years. POPULATION Asymptomatic children younger than 5 years. EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit of preventing future dental caries with oral fluoride supplementation at recommended doses in children 6 months or older whose water supply is deficient in fluoride. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit of preventing future dental caries with fluoride varnish application in all children younger than 5 years. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient on performing routine oral screening examinations for dental caries by primary care clinicians in children younger than 5 years and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening cannot be determined. RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians prescribe oral fluoride supplementation starting at age 6 months for children whose water supply is deficient in fluoride. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians apply fluoride varnish to the primary teeth of all infants and children starting at the age of primary tooth eruption. (B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of routine screening examinations for dental caries performed by primary care clinicians in children younger than 5 years.","[Davidson, Karina W.] Northwell Hlth, Feinstein Inst Med Res, Manhasset, NY USA; [Barry, Michael J.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Mangione, Carol M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Cabana, Michael] Albert Einstein Coll Med, New York, NY USA; [Caughey, Aaron B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Davis, Esa M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Donahue, Katrina E.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Doubeni, Chyke A.] Mayo Clin, Rochester, MN USA; [Kubik, Martha] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Li, Li] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Ogedegbe, Gbenga] NYU, New York, NY USA; [Pbert, Lori] Univ Massachusetts Med Sch, Worcester, MA USA; [Silverstein, Michael] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Stevermer, James] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Univ Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Pacific Hlth Res & Educ Inst, Honolulu, HI USA; [Wong, John B.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02111 USA",,"Davidson, KW (corresponding author), Feinstein Inst Med Res, 130 E 59th St,Ste 14C, New York, NY 10032 USA.",chair@uspstf.net,,,,,,,29,7,7,4,6,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

OBJECTIVE To assess the association of aspirin use for primary prevention with cardiovascular events and bleeding. DATA SOURCES PubMed and Embase were searched on Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials from the earliest available date through November 1, 2018. STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials enrolling at least 1000 participants with no known cardiovascular disease and a follow-up of at least 12 months were included. Included studies compared aspirin use with no aspirin (placebo or no treatment). DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were screened and extracted independently by both investigators. Bayesian and frequentist meta-analyses were performed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary cardiovascular outcome was a composite of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The primary bleeding outcome was any major bleeding (defined by the individual studies). RESULTS A total of 13 trials randomizing 164 225 participants with 1 050 511 participant-years of follow-up were included. The median age of trial participants was 62 years (range, 53-74), 77 501 (47%) were men, 30 361 (19%) had diabetes, and the median baseline risk of the primary cardiovascular outcome was 9.2%(range, 2.6%-15.9%). Aspirin use was associated with significant reductions in the composite cardiovascular outcome compared with no aspirin (57.1 per 10 000 participant-years with aspirin and 61.4 per 10 000 participant-years with no aspirin) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89 [95% credible interval, 0.84-0.95]; absolute risk reduction, 0.38%[95% CI, 0.20%-0.55%]; number needed to treat, 265). Aspirin use was associated with an increased risk of major bleeding events compared with no aspirin (23.1 per 10 000 participant-years with aspirin and 16.4 per 10 000 participant-years with no aspirin) (HR, 1.43 [95% credible interval, 1.30-1.56]; absolute risk increase, 0.47%[95% CI, 0.34%-0.62%]; number needed to harm, 210). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The use of aspirin in individuals without cardiovascular disease was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events and an increased risk of major bleeding.

OBJECTIVE To systematically review randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of opioids for chronic noncancer pain. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION The databases of CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, AMED, and PsycINFO were searched from inception to April 2018 for RCTs of opioids for chronic noncancer pain vs any nonopioid control. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Paired reviewers independently extracted data. The analyses used random-effects models and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation to rate the quality of the evidence. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were pain intensity (score range, 0-10 cm on a visual analog scale for pain; lower is better and the minimally important difference [MID] is 1 cm), physical functioning (score range, 0-100 points on the 36-item Short Form physical component score [SF-36 PCS]; higher is better and the MID is 5 points), and incidence of vomiting. RESULTS Ninety-six RCTs including 26 169 participants (61% female; median age, 58 years [interquartile range, 51-61 years]) were included. Of the included studies, therewere 25 trials of neuropathic pain, 32 trials of nociceptive pain, 33 trials of central sensitization (pain present in the absence of tissue damage), and 6 trials of mixed types of pain. Compared with placebo, opioid use was associated with reduced pain (weighted mean difference [WMD], -0.69 cm [95% CI, -0.82 to -0.56 cm] on a 10-cm visual analog scale for pain; modeled risk difference for achieving the MID, 11.9%[95% CI, 9.7% to 14.1%]), improved physical functioning (WMD, 2.04 points [95% CI, 1.41 to 2.68 points] on the 100-point SF-36 PCS; modeled risk difference for achieving the MID, 8.5%[95% CI, 5.9% to 11.2%]), and increased vomiting (5.9% with opioids vs 2.3% with placebo for trials that excluded patients with adverse events during a run-in period). Low-to moderate-quality evidence suggested similar associations of opioids with improvements in pain and physical functioning compared with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (pain: WMD, -0.60 cm[95% CI, -1.54 to 0.34 cm]; physical functioning: WMD, -0.90 points [95% CI, -2.69 to 0.89 points]), tricyclic antidepressants (pain: WMD, -0.13 cm [95% CI, -0.99 to 0.74 cm]; physical functioning: WMD, -5.31 points [95% CI, -13.77 to 3.14 points]), and anticonvulsants (pain: WMD, -0.90 cm[95% CI, -1.65 to -0.14 cm]; physical functioning: WMD, 0.45 points [95% CI, -5.77 to 6.66 points]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this meta-analysis of RCTs of patients with chronic noncancer pain, evidence from high-quality studies showed that opioid use was associated with statistically significant but small improvements in pain and physical functioning, and increased risk of vomiting compared with placebo. Comparisons of opioids with nonopioid alternatives suggested that the benefit for pain and functioningmay be similar, although the evidence was from studies of only low to moderate quality.","[Busse, Jason W.; Wang, Li; Kaushal, Alka; Couban, Rachel; Ashoorion, Vahid; Rehman, Yasir; Buckley, Norman] McMaster Univ, Michael G DeGroote Inst Pain Res & Care, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Busse, Jason W.; Wang, Li; Schandelmaier, Stefan; Buckley, Norman] McMaster Univ, Dept Anesthesia, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Busse, Jason W.; Craigie, Samantha; Riva, John J.; Mulla, Sohail M.; Kaushal, Alka; Agarwal, Arnav; Hsu, Sandy; Schandelmaier, Stefan; Ebrahim, Shanil; Ross, Stephanie; Johnston, Bradley C.; Sun, Xin; Guyatt, Gordon H.] McMaster Univ, Dept Hlth Res Methods Evidence & Impact, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Busse, Jason W.] McMaster Univ, Michael G DeGroote Ctr Med Cannabis Res, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Wang, Li; Sun, Xin] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Chinese Cochrane Ctr, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Kamaleldin, Mostafa] Ain Shams Univ, Fac Med, Cairo, Egypt; [Riva, John J.] McMaster Univ, Dept Family Med, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Montoya, Luis] Univ Toronto, Krembil Res Inst, Univ Hlth Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Mulla, Sohail M.] Canadian Agcy Drugs & Technol Hlth CADTH, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Lopes, Luciane C.] Univ Sorocaba, Pharmaceut Sci, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Vogel, Nicole] Leonardo Hirslanden Klin Birshof, Munchenstein, Switzerland; [Chen, Eric] McMaster Univ, Michael G DeGroote Sch Med, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Kirmayr, Karin] Hosp Aleman Buenos Aires, Dept Internal Med, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [De Oliveira, Kyle] Univ Ottawa, Dept Anesthesiol & Pain Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Olivieri, Lori] Univ Calgary, Dept Anesthesiol Perioperat & Pain Med, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Kaushal, Alka] Univ Manitoba, Dept Family Med, Max Rady Coll Med, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Chaparro, Luis E.; Oyberman, Inna] Univ Toronto, Dept Anesthesia, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Agarwal, Arnav] Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Tsoi, Ludwig] Queen Mary Hosp, Dept Accid & Emergency, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lam, Tommy] Tuen Mun Hosp, Dept Accid & Emergency, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Vandvik, Per Olav] Innlandet Hosp Trust, Dept Med, Gjovik, Norway; [Bala, Malgorzata M.] Jagiellonian Univ, Coll Med, Fac Med, Dept Hyg & Dietet, Krakow, Poland; [Schandelmaier, Stefan] Univ Basel Hosp, Inst Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Basel, Switzerland; [Schandelmaier, Stefan; Kunz, Regina] Univ Basel Hosp, Dept Clin Res, Basel, Switzerland; [Scheidecker, Anne] Univ Basel Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol Operat Intens Care Preclin Emerg, Basel, Switzerland; [Ashoorion, Vahid] Isfahan Univ Med Sci, Isfahan Med Educ Res Ctr, Esfahan, Iran; [Rehman, Yasir] Canadian Acad Osteopathy, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Hong, Patrick J.] Univ Ottawa, Fac Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Johnston, Bradley C.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Community Hlth & Epidemiol, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Sessler, Daniel I.] Cleveland Clin, Dept Outcomes Res, Inst Anesthesiol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",,"Busse, JW (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Dept Anesthesia, Michael G DeGroote Sch Med, HSC 2V9,1280 Main St W, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.",bussejw@mcmaster.ca,"LOPES, LUCIANE CRUZ/H-1168-2012; Rehman, Yasir/D-5335-2018; Schandelmaier, Stefan/GLV-3722-2022; Lopes, Luciane Cruz/H-3159-2019; Couban, Rachel/AAV-1568-2021; Busse, Jason/CAH-3696-2022; Agarwal, Arnav/J-1553-2014; Wang, Li/T-1407-2017","LOPES, LUCIANE CRUZ/0000-0002-3684-3275; Rehman, Yasir/0000-0002-2817-3638; Schandelmaier, Stefan/0000-0002-8429-0337; Lopes, Luciane Cruz/0000-0002-3684-3275; Couban, Rachel/0000-0001-8672-2845; Busse, Jason/0000-0002-0178-8712; Agarwal, Arnav/0000-0002-0931-7851; De Oliveira, Kyle/0000-0001-6596-321X; Vogel, Nicole/0000-0002-8322-4514; Wang, Li/0000-0003-1585-8846",Canadian Institutes of Health Research [119801]; Health Canada [1516-HQ-000017]; NCMIC Foundation,Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Health Canada; NCMIC Foundation,This study was supported by grant 119801 from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and grant 1516-HQ-000017 from Health Canada.

ObjectiveTo systematically review the effectiveness and safety of pharmacotherapy, behavioral interventions, and electronic cigarettes for tobacco cessation among adults, including pregnant persons, to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force. Data SourcesPubMed, PsycInfo, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination of Health Technology Assessment; surveillance through September 25, 2020. Study SelectionSystematic reviews of tobacco cessation interventions and randomized clinical trials that evaluated the effects of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) or pharmacotherapy among pregnant persons. Data Extraction and SynthesisIndependent critical appraisal and data abstraction; qualitative synthesis and random-effects meta-analyses. Main Outcomes and MeasuresHealth outcomes, tobacco cessation at 6 months or more, and adverse events. ResultsSixty-seven reviews addressing pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions were included as well as 9 trials (N=3942) addressing e-cigarettes for smoking cessation and 7 trials (N=2285) of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) use in pregnancy. Combined pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions (pooled risk ratio [RR], 1.83 [95% CI, 1.68-1.98]), NRT (RR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.49-1.61]), bupropion (RR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.52-1.77]), varenicline (RR, 2.24 [95% CI, 2.06-2.43]), and behavioral interventions such as advice from clinicians (RR, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.58-1.96]) were all associated with increased quit rates compared with minimal support or placebo at 6 months or longer. None of the drugs were associated with serious adverse events. Five trials (n=3117) reported inconsistent findings on the effectiveness of electronic cigarettes on smoking cessation at 6 to 12 months among smokers when compared with placebo or NRT, and none suggested higher rates of serious adverse events. Among pregnant persons, behavioral interventions were associated with greater smoking cessation during late pregnancy (RR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.23-1.48]), compared with no intervention. Rates of validated cessation among pregnant women allocated to NRT compared with placebo were not significantly different (pooled RR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.79-1.56], n=2033). Conclusions and RelevanceThere is strong evidence that a range of pharmacologic and behavioral interventions, both individually and in combination, are effective in increasing smoking cessation in nonpregnant adults. In pregnancy, behavioral interventions are effective for smoking cessation, but data are limited on the use of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. Data on the effectiveness and safety of electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation among adults are also limited and results are inconsistent. This systematic review to support the 2021 US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement on interventions for tobacco cessation in adults summarizes published evidence on the benefits and harms of interventions for tobacco cessation in adults, including pregnant persons.","[Patnode, Carrie D.; Henderson, Jillian T.; Coppola, Erin L.; Thomas, Rachel G.] Kaiser Permanente, Permanente Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Ctr Hlth Res, Portland, OR USA; [Melnikow, Joy; Durbin, Shauna] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Healthcare Policy & Res, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA",,"Patnode, CD (corresponding author), Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Kaiser Permanente Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Ctr Hlth Res, 3800 N Interstate Ave, Portland, OR 97227 USA.",carrie.d.patnode@kpchr.org,,,,,,,118,26,26,3,8,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Early chest compressions and, when indicated, a defibrillation shock from a bystander give the best chance of survival with a good neurological status. Cardiac arrest can also be caused by special circumstances, such as asphyxia, trauma, pulmonary embolism, accidental hypothermia, anaphylaxis, or COVID-19, and during pregnancy or perioperatively. Cardiac arrests in these circumstances represent an increasing proportion of all treated cardiac arrests, often have a preventable cause, and require additional interventions to correct a reversible cause during resuscitation. The evidence for treating these conditions is mostly of low or very low certainty and further studies are needed. Irrespective of the cause, treatments for cardiac arrest are time sensitive and most effective when given early-every minute counts.","[Soar, Jasmeet] North Bristol NHS Trust, Southmead Hosp, Anaesthesia & Intens Care Med, Bristol, Avon, England; [Becker, Lance B.] Northwell Hlth, Zucker Sch Med Hofstra Northwell, Emergency Med, New Hyde Pk, NY USA; [Berg, Katherine M.] Ctr Resuscitat Sci, Boston, MA USA; [Einav, Sharon] Shaare Zedek Med Ctr, Surg Intens Care, Jerusalem, Israel; [Ma, Qingbian] Peking Univ Third Hosp, Emergency Med, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Olasveengen, Theresa M.] Univ Oslo, Div Emergencies & Crit Care, Oslo, Norway; [Paal, Peter] St John God Hosp, Anaesthesiol & Intens Care, Salzburg, Austria; [Parr, Michael J.

We assessed the safety and efficacy of guided versus standard selection of antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing PCI. Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, from Aug 20 to Oct 25, 2020, we searched MEDLINE (via PubMed), Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science databases for randomised controlled trials and observational studies published in any language that compared guided antiplatelet therapy, by means of platelet function testing or genetic testing, versus standard antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing PCI. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility, extracted the data, and assessed risk of bias. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs were used with random-effects or fixed-effect models according to the estimated heterogeneity among studies assessed by the I-2 index. Coprimary endpoints were trial-defined primary major adverse cardiovascular events and any bleeding. Key secondary endpoints were all-cause death, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, definite or probable stent thrombosis, and major and minor bleeding. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021215901). Findings 3656 potentially relevant articles were screened. Our analysis included 11 randomised controlled trials and three observational studies with data for 20 743 patients. Compared with standard therapy, guided selection of antiplatelet therapy was associated with a reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63-0.95, p=0.015) and reduced bleeding, although not statistically significant (RR 0.88, 0.77-1.01, p=0.069). Cardiovascular death (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.59-1.00, p=0.049), myocardial infarction (RR 0.76, 0.60-0.96, p=0.021), stent thrombosis (RR 0.64, 0.46-0.89, p=0.011), stroke (RR 0.66, 0.48-0.91, p=0.010), and minor bleeding (RR 0.78, 0.67-0.92, p=0.0030) were reduced with guided therapy compared with standard therapy. Risks of all-cause death and major bleeding did not differ between guided and standard approaches. Outcomes varied according to the strategy used, with an escalation approach associated with a significant reduction in ischaemic events without any trade-off in safety, and a de-escalation approach associated with a significant reduction in bleeding, without any trade-off in efficacy. Interpretation Guided selection of antiplatelet therapy improved both composite and individual efficacy outcomes with a favourable safety profile, driven by a reduction in minor bleeding, supporting the use of platelet function or genetic testing to optimise the choice of agent in patients undergoing PCI.

Unique features include innovative Maori services, the no-fault accident compensation scheme, and the Pharmaceutical Management Agency, which negotiates with pharmaceutical companies to get the best value for medicines purchased by public money. The so-called universal orientation of the health system, along with a strong commitment to social service provision, have contributed to New Zealand's favourable health statistics. However, despite a long-standing commitment to reducing health inequities, problems with access to care persist and the system is not delivering the promise of equitable health outcomes for all population groups. Primary health services and hospital-based services have developed largely independently, and major restructuring during the 1990s did not produce the expected efficiency gains. A focus on individual-level secondary services and performance targets has been prioritised over tackling issues such as suicide, obesity, and poverty-related diseases through community-based health promotion, preventive activities, and primary care. Future changes need to focus on strengthening the culture and capacity of the system to improve equity of outcomes, including expanding Maori health service provision, integrating existing services and structures with new ones, aligning resources with need to achieve pro-equity outcomes, and strengthening population-based approaches to tackling contemporary drivers of health status.","[Goodyear-Smith, Felicity] Univ Auckland, Dept Gen Practice & Primary Hlth Care, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Ashton, Toni] Univ Auckland, Hlth Syst, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Auckland 1142, New Zealand",,"Goodyear-Smith, F (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Dept Gen Practice & Primary Hlth Care, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",f.goodyear-smith@auckland.ac.nz,,,,,,,89,44,44,2,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,AUG 3,2019,394,10196,,,,,432,442,,10.1016/S0140-6736(19)31238-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(19)31238-3,,,11,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),General & Internal Medicine,IN5EI,31379334,,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000478698300028,View Full Record in Web of Science,23311,1,76,4,25,34,23,80,66,55,64,57,72,4,20,66,36

Underuse leads to maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Conversely, overuse of CS has not shown benefits and can create harm. Worldwide, the frequency of CS continues to increase, and interventions to reduce unnecessary CSs have shown little success. Identifying the underlying factors for the continuing increase in CS use could improve the efficacy of interventions. In this Series paper, we describe the factors for CS use that are associated with women, families, health professionals, and health-care organisations and systems, and we examine behavioural, psychosocial, health system, and financial factors. We also outline the type and effects of interventions to reduce CS use that have been investigated. Clinical interventions, such as external cephalic version for breech delivery at term, vaginal breech delivery in appropriately selected women, and vaginal birth after CS, could reduce the frequency of CS use. Approaches such as labour companionship and midwife-led care have been associated with higher proportions of physiological births, safer outcomes, and lower health-care costs relative to control groups without these interventions, and with positive maternal experiences, in high-income countries. Such approaches need to be assessed in middle-income and low-income countries. Educational interventions for women should be complemented with meaningful dialogue with health professionals and effective emotional support for women and families. Investing in the training of health professionals, eliminating financial incentives for CS use, and reducing fear of litigation is fundamental. Safe, private, welcoming, and adequately resourced facilities are needed. At the country level, effective medical leadership is essential to ensure CS is used only when indicated. We conclude that interventions to reduce overuse must be multicomponent and locally tailored, addressing women's and health professionals' concerns, as well as health system and financial factors.","[Betran, Ana Pilar; Gulmezoglu, Ahmet Metin] WHO, Dept Reprod Hlth & Res, UNDP UNFPA UNICEF WHO World Bank Special Programm, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Temmerman, Marleen; Mohiddin, Abdu; Wanyonyi, Sikolia Z.] Aga Khan Univ, Ctr Excellence Women & Child Hlth, Nairobi, Kenya; [Temmerman, Marleen] Univ Ghent, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Ghent, Belgium; [Kingdon, Carol; Downe, Soo] Univ Cent Lancashire, Fac Hlth & Wellbeing, Sch Community Hlth & Midwifery, Preston, Lancs, England; [Opiyo, Newton] Cochrane, Review Prod & Qual Unit, London, England; [Torloni, Maria Regina] Sao Paulo Fed Univ, Postgrad Program Evidence Based Healthcare, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Zhang, Jun] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Xinhua Hosp, MOE Shanghai Key Lab Childrens Environm Hlth, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Musana, Othiniel] Uganda Martyrs Univ, St Francis Hosp Nsambya, Kampala, Uganda",,"Betran, AP (corresponding author), WHO, Dept Reprod Hlth & Res, UNDP UNFPA UNICEF WHO World Bank Special Programm, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",betrana@who.int,,"Kingdon, Carol/0000-0002-5958-9257",,,,,123,185,189,3,49,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,OCT 13,2018,392,10155,,,,,1358,1368,,10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31927-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31927-5,,,11,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),General & Internal Medicine,GW6QU,30322586,Green Accepted,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000447086500038,View Full Record in Web of Science,23694,1,26,21,70,60,26,81,75,55,7,20,111,7,117,16,107

There were approximately 38 300 new diagnoses of HIV infection in 2017. The estimated prevalence of HIV infection among persons 13 years and older in the United States is 0.4%, and data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show a significant increase in HIV diagnoses starting at age 15 years. An estimated 8700 women living with HIV give birth each year in the United States. HIV can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy, labor, delivery, and breastfeeding. The incidence of perinatal HIV infection in the United States peaked in 1992 and has declined significantly following the implementation of routine prenatal HIV screening and the use of effective therapies and precautions to prevent mother-to-child transmission. OBJECTIVE To update the 2013 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for HIV infection in adolescents, adults, and pregnant women. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for HIV infection in nonpregnant adolescents and adults, the yield of screening for HIV infection at different intervals, the effects of initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) at a higher vs lower CD4 cell count, and the longer-term harms associated with currently recommended ART regimens. The USPSTF also reviewed the evidence on the benefits (specifically, reduced risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection) and harms of screening for HIV infection in pregnant persons, the yield of repeat screening for HIV at different intervals during pregnancy, the effectiveness of currently recommended ART regimens for reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection, and the harms of ART during pregnancy to the mother and infant. FINDINGS The USPSTF found convincing evidence that currently recommended HIV tests are highly accurate in diagnosing HIV infection. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that identification and early treatment of HIV infection is of substantial benefit in reducing the risk of AIDS-related events or death. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that the use of ART is of substantial benefit in decreasing the risk of HIV transmission to uninfected sex partners. The USPSTF also found convincing evidence that identification and treatment of pregnant women living with HIV infection is of substantial benefit in reducing the rate of mother-to-child transmission. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that ART is associated with some harms, including neuropsychiatric, renal, and hepatic harms, and an increased risk of preterm birth in pregnant women. The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the net benefit of screening for HIV infection in adolescents, adults, and pregnant women is substantial. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF recommends screening for HIV infection in adolescents and adults aged 15 to 65 years. Younger adolescents and older adults who are at increased risk of infection should also be screened. (A recommendation) The USPSTF recommends screening for HIV infection in all pregnant persons, including those who present in labor or at delivery whose HIV status is unknown.

In most patients, the most important in-hospital interventions other than routine intensive care are continuous active treatment (in non-comatose and comatose patients and including circulatory support in selected patients), cooling of core temperature to 32-36 degrees C by targeted temperature management for at least 24 h, immediate coronary angiography with or without percutaneous coronary intervention, and delay of final prognosis until at least 72 h after OHCA.

How the safety profile of new-generation DES compares with that of bare-metal stents (BMS) is less clear. Methods We did an individual patient data meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials to compare outcomes after implantation of new-generation DES or BMS among patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. The primary outcome was the composite of cardiac death or myocardial infarction. Data were pooled in a one-stage random-effects meta-analysis and examined at maximum follow-up and a 1-year landmark. Risk estimates are reported as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs. This study is registered in PROSPERO, number CRD42017060520. Findings We obtained individual data for 26 616 patients in 20 randomised trials. Mean follow-up was 3.2 (SD 1.8) years. The risk of the primary outcome was reduced in DES recipients compared with BMS recipients (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.78-0.90, p<0.001) owing to a reduced risk of myocardial infarction (0.79, 0.71-0.88, p<0.001) and a possible slight but non-significant cardiac mortality benefit (0.89, 0.78-1.01, p=0.075). All-cause death was unaffected (HR with DES 0.96, 95% CI 0.88-1.05, p=0.358), but risk was lowered for definite stent thrombosis (0.63, 0.50-0.80, p<0.001) and target-vessel revascularisation (0.55, 0.50-0.60, p<0.001). We saw a time-dependent treatment effect, with DES being associated with lower risk of the primary outcome than BMS up to 1 year after placement. While the effect was maintained in the longer term, there was no further divergence from BMS after 1 year. Interpretation The performance of new-generation DES in the first year after implantation means that BMS should no longer be considered the gold standard for safety. Further development of DES technology should target improvements in clinical outcomes beyond 1 year. Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

OBJECTIVE To conduct a targeted systematic review to update the evidence on the effectiveness of screening for COPD and the treatment of COPD to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) update of the 2016 recommendation statement on COPD screening. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL for relevant studies published between January 1, 2015, to January 22, 2021; surveillance through March 25, 2022. STUDY SELECTION English-language studies of screening in individuals who do not recognize or report respiratory symptoms; studies of treatment in persons with mild or moderate, or minimally symptomatic, COPD. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers independently appraised the articles and extracted relevant data from fair- or good-quality studies; no quantitative synthesis was conducted. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES COPD-related morbidity or mortality, measures of health-related quality of life, and adverse events. RESULTS The review included no trials on the effectiveness of screening, 3 trials or analyses (n = 20 058) of pharmacologic treatment published since 2015, 13 trials (n = 3657) on nonpharmacologic interventions, and 2 large observational studies (n = 243 517) addressing the harms of pharmacologic treatment published since 2015. The results from the clinical trials of pharmacologic therapy are consistent with the previous review supporting the USPSTF that bronchodilators with or without inhaled corticosteroids can reduce COPD exacerbations and tiotropium can improve health-related quality of life in adults with moderate COPD. Overall, there was no consistent benefit observed for any type of nonpharmacologic intervention across a range of patient outcomes. None of the included treatment trials that reported adverse effects found significant harms. Two large observational studies in a screen-relevant population demonstrated an association of the initiation of a long-acting muscarinic antagonist or long-acting beta agonist with the risk of a serious cardiovascular event in treatment-naive patients and an association of inhaled corticosteroids use with the risk of developing diabetes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings of this targeted evidence update are generally consistent with the findings of the previous systematic review supporting the 2016 USPSTF recommendation. Evidence of pharmacologic treatment was still largely limited to persons with moderate airflow obstruction, and there was no consistent benefit observed for a range of nonpharmacologic interventions in mild to moderate COPD or in minimally symptomatic persons with COPD.","[Webber, Elizabeth M.; Lin, Jennifer S.; Thomas, Rachel G.] Kaiser Permanente, Ctr Hlth Res, Kaiser Permanente Evidence based Practice Ctr, 3800 N Interstate Ave, Portland, OR 97227 USA",,"Lin, JS (corresponding author), Kaiser Permanente, Ctr Hlth Res, Kaiser Permanente Evidence based Practice Ctr, 3800 N Interstate Ave, Portland, OR 97227 USA.",jennifer.s.lin@kpchr.org,,,,,,,28,2,2,2,2,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

OBJECTIVE To systematically synthesize the outcomes and adverse events associated with triple therapy (ICS, LABA, and LAMA) vs dual therapy (ICS plus LABA) in children and adults with persistent uncontrolled asthma. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, ICTRP, FDA, and EMA databases from November 2017, to December 8, 2020, without language restriction. STUDY SELECTION Two investigators independently selected randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing triple vs dual therapy in patients with moderate to severe asthma. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Random-effects meta-analyses, including individual patient-level exacerbation data, were used. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach was used to assess certainty (quality) of the evidence. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Severe exacerbations, asthma control (measured using the Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ-7], a 7-item list with each item ranging from 0 [totally controlled] to 6 [severely uncontrolled]; minimal important difference, 0.5), quality of life (measured using the Asthma-related Quality of Life [AQLQ] tool; score range, 1 [severely impaired] to 7 [no impairment]; minimal important difference, 0.5), mortality, and adverse events. RESULTS Twenty RCTs using 3 LAMA types that enrolled 11 894 children and adults (mean age, 52 years [range, 9-71 years]; 57.7% female) were included. High-certainty evidence showed that triple therapy vs dual therapy was significantly associated with a reduction in severe exacerbation risk (9 trials [9932 patients]; 22.7% vs 27.4%; risk ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.77 to 0.90]) and an improvement in asthma control (14 trials [11 230 patients]; standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.06 [95% CI, -0.10 to -0.02]; mean difference in ACQ-7 scale, -0.04 [95% CI, -0.07 to -0.01]). There were no significant differences in asthma-related quality of life (7 trials [5247 patients]; SMD, 0.05 [95% CI, -0.03 to 0.13]; mean difference in AQLQ score, 0.05 [95% CI, -0.03 to 0.13]; moderate-certainty evidence) or mortality (17 trials [11 595 patients]; 0.12% vs 0.12%; risk ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.33 to 2.75]; high-certainty evidence) between dual and triple therapy. Triple therapy was significantly associated with increased dry mouth and dysphonia (10 trials [7395 patients]; 3.0% vs 1.8%; risk ratio, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.14 to 2.38]; high-certainty evidence), but treatment-related and serious adverse events were not significantly different between groups (moderate-certainty evidence). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among children (aged 6 to 18 years) and adults with moderate to severe asthma, triple therapy, compared with dual therapy, was significantly associated with fewer severe asthma exacerbations and modest improvements in asthma control without significant differences in quality of life or mortality.","[Kim, Lisa H.

OBJECTIVE To systematically review evidence on benefits and harms of ovarian cancer screening among average-risk women to inform the United States Preventive Services Task Force. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials; studies published in English from January 1, 2003, through January 31, 2017; ongoing surveillance in targeted publications through November 22, 2017. STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials of ovarian cancer screening in average-risk women that reported mortality or quality-of-life outcomes. Interventions included transvaginal ultrasound, cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) testing, or their combination. Comparators were usual care or no screening. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Independent critical appraisal and data abstraction by 2 reviewers. Meta-analytic pooling of results was not conducted because of the small number of studies and heterogeneity of interventions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Ovarian cancer mortality, false-positive screening results and surgery, surgical complications, and psychological effects of screening. RESULTS Four trials (N = 293 587) were included; of these, 3 (n = 293 038) assessed ovarian cancer mortality, and 1 (n = 549) reported only on psychological outcomes. Evaluated screening interventions included transvaginal ultrasound alone, transvaginal ultrasound plus CA-125 testing, and CA-125 testing alone. Test positivity for CA-125 was defined by a fixed serum level cutpoint or by a proprietary risk algorithm based on CA-125 level, change in CA-125 level over time, and age (risk of ovarian cancer algorithm [ROCA]). No trial found a significant difference in ovarian cancer mortality with screening. In the 2 large screening trials (PLCO and UKCTOCS, n = 271 103), there was not a statistically significant difference in complete intention-to-screen analyses of ovarian, fallopian, and peritoneal cancer cases associated with screening (PLCO: rate ratio, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.82-1.71]; UKCTOCS: hazard ratio [HR], 0.91 [95% CI, 0.76-1.09] for transvaginal ultrasound and HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.74-1.08] for CA-125 ROCA). Within these 2 trials, screening led to surgery for suspected ovarian cancer in 1% of women without cancer for CA-125 ROCA and in 3% for transvaginal ultrasound with or without CA-125 screening, with major complications occurring among 3% to 15% of surgery. Evidence on psychological harms was limited but nonsignificant except in the case of repeat follow-up scans and tests, which increased the risk of psychological morbidity in a subsample of UKCTOCS participants based on the General Health Questionnaire 12 (score >= 4) (odds ratio, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.18-1.39]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In randomized trials conducted among average-risk, asymptomatic women, ovarian cancer mortality did not significantly differ between screened women and those with no screening or in usual care. Screening harms included surgery (with major surgical complications) in women found to not have cancer. Further research is needed to identify effective approaches for reducing ovarian cancer incidence and mortality.","[Henderson, Jillian T.; Webber, Elizabeth M.] Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Ctr Hlth Res, Kaiser Permanente Res Affiliates Evidence Based P, 3800 N Interstate Ave, Portland, OR 97227 USA; [Sawaya, George F.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Obstet Gynecol & Reprod Sci, San Francisco, CA USA",,"Henderson, JT (corresponding author), Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Ctr Hlth Res, Kaiser Permanente Res Affiliates Evidence Based P, 3800 N Interstate Ave, Portland, OR 97227 USA.",Jillian.T.Henderson@kpchr.org,,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA290201500007I]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA290201500007I, Task Order 2, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the USPSTF.",,55,151,164,2,30,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Because the median age of patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma is in the mid-30s, the disease's impact on the number of years lost from productive life is remarkable.

Atrial fibrillation is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke, increasing risk of stroke by as much as 5-fold. Approximately 20% of patients who have a stroke associated with atrial fibrillation are first diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the time of stroke or shortly thereafter. OBJECTIVE To issue a new US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for atrial fibrillation with electrocardiography (ECG). EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for atrial fibrillation with ECG in adults 65 years and older, the effectiveness of screening with ECG for detecting previously undiagnosed atrial fibrillation compared with usual care, and the benefits and harms of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy for the treatment of screen-detected atrial fibrillation in older adults. FINDINGS Most older adults with previously undiagnosed atrial fibrillation have a stroke risk above the threshold for anticoagulant therapy and would be eligible for treatment. Anticoagulant therapy is effective for stroke prevention in symptomatic persons with atrial fibrillation and high stroke risk. However, the USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine whether screening with ECG and subsequent treatment in asymptomatic adults is more effective than usual care. At the same time, the harms of diagnostic follow-up and treatment prompted by abnormal ECG results are well established and include misdiagnosis and invasive testing. Given these uncertainties, it is not possible to determine the net benefit of screening with ECG. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for atrial fibrillation with ECG.

Despite its importance, NASH is underrecognized in clinical practice. OBSERVATIONS NASH affects an estimated 3% to 6% of the US population and the prevalence is increasing. NASH is strongly associated with obesity, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Although a number of noninvasive tests and scoring systems exist to characterize NAFLD and NASH, liver biopsy is the only accepted method for diagnosis of NASH. Currently, no NASH-specific therapies are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Lifestyle modification is the mainstay of treatment, including dietary changes and exercise, with the primary goal being weight loss. Substantial improvement in histologic outcomes, including fibrosis, is directly correlated with increasing weight loss. In some cases, bariatric surgery may be indicated to achieve and maintain the necessary degree of weight loss required for therapeutic effect. An estimated 20% of patients with NASH will develop cirrhosis, and NASH is predicted to become the leading indication for liver transplants in the US. The mortality rate among patients with NASH is substantially higher than the general population or patients without this inflammatory subtype of NAFLD, with annual all-cause mortality rate of 25.56 per 1000 person-years and a liver-specific mortality rate of 11.77 per 1000 person-years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis affects 3% to 6% of the US population, is more prevalent in patients with metabolic disease and obesity, progresses to cirrhosis in approximately 20% of cases, and is associated with increased rates of liver-specific and overall mortality. Early identification and targeted treatment of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis are needed to improve patient outcomes, including directing patients toward intensive lifestyle modification to promote weight loss and referral for bariatric surgery as indicated for management of obesity and metabolic disease.","[Sheka, Adam C.; Ikramuddin, Sayeed] Univ Minnesota, Dept Surg, 420 Delaware St SE,MMC 195, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Adeyi, Oyedele] Univ Minnesota, Dept Lab Med & Pathol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Thompson, Julie] Univ Minnesota, Dept Med, Div Gastroenterol Hepatol & Nutr, Box 736 UMHC, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Hameed, Bilal] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, Div Gastroenterol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Crawford, Peter A.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Med, Div Mol Med, Box 736 UMHC, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",,"Ikramuddin, S (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Surg, 420 Delaware St SE,MMC 195, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",ikram001@umn.edu,,"Crawford, Peter/0000-0001-8597-4426","National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R21 DK122832]","National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), National Institutes of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK))","Drs Ikramuddin and Crawford are supported by grant R21 DK122832 from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), National Institutes of Health (NIH).",,70,260,271,39,110,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

OBJECTIVE To update the 2013 US Preventive Services Task Force systematic review on medications to reduce risk of primary (first diagnosis) invasive breast cancer in women. DATA SOURCES Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, and MEDLINE (January 1, 2013, to February 1, 2019); manual review of reference lists. STUDY SELECTION Discriminatory accuracy studies of breast cancer risk assessment methods; randomized clinical trials of tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors for primary breast cancer prevention; studies of medication adverse effects. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Investigators abstracted data on methods, participant characteristics, eligibility criteria, outcome ascertainment, and follow-up. Results of individual trials were combined by using a profile likelihood random-effects model. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Probability of breast cancer in individuals (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]); incidence of breast cancer, fractures, thromboembolic events, coronary heart disease events, stroke, endometrial cancer, and cataracts; and mortality. RESULTS A total of 46 studies (82 articles [> 5 million participants]) were included. Eighteen risk assessment methods in 25 studies reported low accuracy in predicting the probability of breast cancer in individuals (AUC, 0.55-0.65). In placebo-controlled trials, tamoxifen (risk ratio [RR], 0.69 [95% CI, 0.59-0.84]; 4 trials [n = 28 421]), raloxifene (RR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.24-0.80]; 2 trials [n = 17 806]), and the aromatase inhibitors exemestane and anastrozole (RR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.26-0.70]; 2 trials [n = 8424]) were associated with a lower incidence of invasive breast cancer. Risk for invasive breast cancer was higher for raloxifene than tamoxifen in 1 trial after long-term follow-up (RR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.05-1.47]; n = 19 747). Raloxifene was associated with lower risk for vertebral fractures (RR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.53-0.73]; 2 trials [n = 16 929]) and tamoxifen was associated with lower risk for nonvertebral fractures (RR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.45-0.98]; 1 trial [n = 13 388]) compared with placebo. Tamoxifen and raloxifene were associated with increased thromboembolic events compared with placebo; tamoxifen was associated with more events than raloxifene. Tamoxifen was associated with higher risk of endometrial cancer and cataracts compared with placebo. Symptomatic effects (eg, vasomotor, musculoskeletal) varied by medication. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors were associated with lower risk of primary invasive breast cancer in women but also were associated with adverse effects that differed between medications. Risk stratification methods to identify patients with increased breast cancer risk demonstrated low accuracy.","[Nelson, Heidi D.; Fu, Rongwei; Zakher, Bernadette; Pappas, Miranda; McDonagh, Marian] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Pacific Northwest Evidence Based Practice Ctr, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd,Mail Code BICC, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Fu, Rongwei; Zakher, Bernadette] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Portland, OR 97201 USA",,"Nelson, HD (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Pacific Northwest Evidence Based Practice Ctr, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd,Mail Code BICC, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",nelsonh@ohsu.edu,,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA290201500009I]; US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services; US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)","This research was funded under contract HHSA290201500009I, Task Order 7, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).",,115,38,42,0,2,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Genomic and environmental factors as well as aberrant immune maturation early in life can contribute to the onset of disease, with great disparity over time and geographical regions. Epidemiological studies have scrutinised environmental exposures and attempted to translate these exposures into prevention strategies. Some approaches for patients with asthma have been successful (eg, smoking ban, the Finnish Asthma Programme), and primary prevention of wheeze in pre-school children (age 0-5 years) by the supplementation of vitamin D or fish oil, or both, to pregnant women seems promising. Several recent prevention initiatives are based on strong asthma-protective environmental microbial exposures associated with traditional rural lifestyles. Preclinical studies with various bacterial lysates, bacterial and dietary metabolites, or helminthic compounds have yielded promising results that await translation into clinical practice. Given the immense societal and individual burden of asthma, there is an urgent need to further develop novel strategies to eradicate the disease.","[von Mutius, Erika] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Pediat, Dr von Hauner Childrens Hosp, Munich, Germany; [von Mutius, Erika] German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Helmholtz Zentrum Muenchen, Inst Asthma & Allergy Prevent, Neuherberg, Germany; [von Mutius, Erika] German Ctr Lung Res, Comprehens Pneumol Ctr Munich, Neuherberg, Germany; [Smits, Hermelijn H.] Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Parasitol, Ctr Infect Dis, Leiden, Netherlands",,"von Mutius, E (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dr von Hauner Childrens Hosp, D-80337 Munich, Germany.",erika.von.mutius@med.lmu.de,,,,,,,94,56,56,4,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,SEP 19,2020,396,10254,,,,,854,866,,10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31861-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31861-4,,,13,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,OC4PV,32910907,Green Published,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000579141200036,View Full Record in Web of Science,26108,1,61,50,72,7,94,5,2,72,9,57,15,86,85,93,12

Approximately 14% of abused children experienced multiple forms of maltreatment, and more than 1700 children died as a result of maltreatment. OBJECTIVE To update the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2013 recommendation on primary care interventions to prevent child maltreatment. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on primary care interventions to prevent maltreatment in children and adolescents without signs or symptoms of maltreatment. FINDINGS The USPSTF found limited and inconsistent evidence on the benefits of primary care interventions, including home visitation programs, to prevent child maltreatment and found no evidence related to the harms of such interventions. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of primary care interventions to prevent child maltreatment. The level of certainty of the magnitude of the benefits and harms of these interventions is low.

Despite substantial workforce planning efforts, the effectiveness of this planning has been criticised. Education, training, and workforce plans have typically considered each health-care profession in isolation and have not adequately responded to changing health and care needs. The results are persistent vacancies, poor morale, and low retention. Areas of particular concern highlighted in this Health Policy paper include primary care, mental health, nursing, clinical and non-clinical support, and social care. Responses to workforce shortfalls have included a high reliance on foreign and temporary staff, smallscale changes in skill mix, and enhanced recruitment drives. Impending challenges for the UK health and care workforce include growing multimorbidity, an increasing shortfall in the supply of unpaid carers, and the relative decline of the attractiveness of the National Health Service (NHS) as an employer internationally. We argue that to secure a sustainable and fit-for-purpose health and care workforce, integrated workforce approaches need to be developed alongside reforms to education and training that reflect changes in roles and skill mix, as well as the trend towards multidisciplinary working. Enhancing career development opportunities, promoting staff wellbeing, and tackling discrimination in the NHS are all needed to improve recruitment, retention, and morale of staff. An urgent priority is to offer sufficient aftercare and support to staff who have been exposed to high-risk situations and traumatic experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to growing calls to recognise and reward health and care staff, growth in pay must at least keep pace with projected rises in average earnings, which in turn will require linking future NHS funding allocations to rises in pay. Through illustrative projections, we show that, to sustain annual growth in the workforce at approximately 2.4%, increases in NHS expenditure of 4% annually in real terms will be required. Above all, a radical long-term strategic vision is needed to ensure that the future NHS workforce is fit for purpose.","[Anderson, Michael; Street, Andrew; Woods, Michael; Johnston-Webber, Charlotte; Pitchforth, Emma; Mossialos, Elias; Asaria, Miqdad; McGuire, Alistair] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Hlth Policy, London WC2A 2AE, England; [O'Neill, Ciaran] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Med Dent & Biomed Sci, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Clark, Jill Macleod] Univ Southampton, Fac Hlth Sci, Southampton, Hants, England; [Charlesworth, Anita] Hlth Fdn, London, England; [Charlesworth, Anita] Univ Birmingham, Coll Social Sci, Hlth Serv Management Ctr, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Whyte, Moira] Univ Edinburgh, Coll Med & Vet Med, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Foster, Margaret] NHS Wales Shared Serv Partnership, Cardiff, Wales; [Majeed, Azeem] Imperial Coll London, Dept Primary Care & Publ Hlth, London, England; [Pitchforth, Emma] Univ Exeter, Coll Med & Hlth, Exeter, Devon, England",,"Anderson, M (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Hlth Policy, London WC2A 2AE, England.",m.anderson5@lse.ac.uk,"Asaria, Miqdad/T-9980-2019; Mossialos, Elias/ABE-1301-2021","Asaria, Miqdad/0000-0002-3538-4417; Majeed, Azeem/0000-0002-2357-9858",LSE Knowledge and Exchange Impact (KEI) fund from Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF),LSE Knowledge and Exchange Impact (KEI) fund from Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF),"We would like to acknowledge the assistance of Josephine Lloyd who contributed to the analysis of health and care workforce strategies in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

OBSERVATIONS Subclinical hypothyroidism is most often caused by autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis. However, serum thyrotropin levels rise as people without thyroid disease age; serum thyrotropin concentrations may surpass the upper limit of the traditional reference range of 4 to 5mU/L among elderly patients. This phenomenon has likely led to an overestimation of the true prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in persons older than 70 years. In patients who have circulating thyroid peroxidase antibodies, there is a greater risk of progression from subclinical to overt hypothyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism may be associated with an increased risk of heart failure, coronary artery disease events, and mortality from coronary heart disease. In addition, middle-aged patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may have cognitive impairment, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, and altered mood. In the absence of large randomized trials showing benefit from levothyroxine therapy, the rationale for treatment is based on the potential for decreasing the risk of adverse cardiovascular events and the possibility of preventing progression to overt hypothyroidism. However, levothyroxine therapy may be associated with iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis, especially in elderly patients, and there is no evidence that it is beneficial in persons aged 65 years or older. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Subclinical hypothyroidism is common and most individuals can be observed without treatment. Treatment might be indicated for patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and serum thyrotropin levels of 10 mU/L or higher or for young and middle-aged individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism and symptoms consistent with mild hypothyroidism.","[Biondi, Bernadette] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Clin Med & Surg, Naples, Italy; [Cappola, Anne R.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Cooper, David S.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, 1830 E Monument St,Ste 333, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA",,"Cooper, DS (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Div Endocrinol Diabet & Metab, 1830 E Monument St,Ste 333, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA.",dscooper@jhmi.edu,"Biondi, Bernadette/AAH-7664-2020","Biondi, Bernadette/0000-0001-8360-4464",,,,,78,164,177,18,60,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Education and training campaigns are needed to improve both the recognition of stroke among the general public and the response of emergency medical services. Specialised stroke ambulances (mobile stroke units) have been piloted in many cities to speed up the diagnosis, triage, and emergency treatment of people with acute stroke symptoms. Hospital-based interdisciplinary stroke units remain the central feature of a modern stroke service. Many have now developed a role in the very early phase (hyperacute units) plus outreach for patients who return home (early supported discharge services). Different levels (comprehensive and primary) of stroke centre and telemedicine networks have been developed to coordinate the various service components with specialist investigations and interventions including rehabilitation. Major challenges include the harmonisation of resources for stroke across the whole patient journey (including the rapid, accurate triage of patients who require highly specialised treatment in comprehensive stroke centres) and the development of technology to improve communication across different parts of a service.","[Langhorne, Peter] Univ Glasgow, Royal Infirm, Inst Cardiovasc & Med Sci, Glasgow G31 2ER, Lanark, Scotland; [Audebert, Heinrich J.] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Dept Neurol, Berlin, Germany; [Audebert, Heinrich J.] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Ctr Stroke Res Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Cadilhac, Dominique A.; Kim, Joosup] Monash Univ, Dept Med, Sch Clin Sci, Monash Hlth, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Lindsay, Patrice] Heart & Stroke Fdn Canada, Toronto, ON, Canada",,"Langhorne, P (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Royal Infirm, Inst Cardiovasc & Med Sci, Glasgow G31 2ER, Lanark, Scotland.",peter.langhorne@glasgow.ac.uk,,"Audebert, Heinrich/0000-0002-4785-0366",,,,,98,3,3,2,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,OCT 31,2020,396,10260,,,,,1433,1442,,,,,,10,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,OI1EY,33129394,Green Accepted,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000583031700032,View Full Record in Web of Science,26608,1,16,10,1,44,29,23,32,60,75,30,97,72,39,16,34

Data Sources MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through September 18, 2018; literature surveillance through September 21, 2019. Study Selection Test accuracy studies to detect drug misuse and randomized clinical trials of screening and interventions to reduce drug use. Data Extraction and Synthesis Critical appraisal and data abstraction by 2 reviewers and random-effects meta-analyses. Main Outcomes and Measures Sensitivity, specificity, drug use and other health, social, and legal outcomes. Results Ninety-nine studies (N = 84 206) were included. Twenty-eight studies (n = 65 720) addressed drug screening accuracy. Among adults, sensitivity and specificity of screening tools for detecting unhealthy drug use ranged from 0.71 to 0.94 and 0.87 to 0.97, respectively. Interventions to reduce drug use were evaluated in 52 trials (n = 15 659) of psychosocial interventions, 7 trials (n = 1109) of opioid agonist therapy, and 13 trials (n = 1718) of naltrexone. Psychosocial interventions were associated with increased likelihood of drug use abstinence (15 trials, n = 3636; relative risk [RR], 1.60 [95% CI, 1.24 to 2.13]; absolute risk difference [ARD], 9% [95% CI, 5% to 15%]) and reduced number of drug use days (19 trials, n = 5085; mean difference, -0.49 day in the last 7 days [95% CI, -0.85 to -0.13]) vs no psychosocial intervention at 3- to 4-month follow-up. In treatment-seeking populations, opioid agonist therapy and naltrexone were associated with decreased risk of drug use relapse (4 trials, n = 567; RR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.59 to 0.82]; ARD, -35% [95% CI, -67% to -3%] and 12 trials, n = 1599; RR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.85]; ARD, -18% [95% CI, -26% to -10%], respectively) vs placebo or no medication. While evidence on harms was limited, it indicated no increased risk of serious adverse events. Conclusions and Relevance Several screening instruments with acceptable sensitivity and specificity are available to screen for drug use, although there is no direct evidence on the benefits or harms of screening. Pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions are effective at improving drug use outcomes, but evidence of effectiveness remains primarily derived from trials conducted in treatment-seeking populations.","[Patnode, Carrie D.; Perdue, Leslie A.; Rushkin, Megan; O'Connor, Elizabeth A.] Kaiser Permanente, Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Ctr Hlth Res, Portland, OR USA; [Dana, Tracy; Blazina, Ian; Bougatsos, Christina; Grusing, Sara; Fu, Rongwei; Chou, Roger] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Pacific Northwest Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Dept Med Informat & Clin Epidemiol, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Fu, Rongwei] Portland State Univ, Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [Chou, Roger] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Div Gen Internal Med & Geriatr, Portland, OR 97201 USA",,"Patnode, CD (corresponding author), Kaiser Permanente, Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Ctr Hlth Res, Kaiser Permanente Northwest, 3800 N Interstate Ave, Portland, OR 97227 USA.",carrie.d.patnode@kpchr.org,,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA-290-2015-00007-I-EPC5]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA-290-2015-00007-I-EPC5, Task Order 2, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).",,146,17,17,5,8,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Objective To update the evidence on screening and treatment of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy for the US Preventive Services Task Force. Data Sources MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries through May 29, 2019; bibliographies from retrieved articles, experts, and surveillance of the literature through December 31, 2019. Study Selection Fair- or good-quality English-language studies evaluating diagnostic accuracy of tests feasible within primary care; randomized clinical trials (RCTs); nonrandomized controlled intervention studies (for harms only); or meta-analyses of metronidazole or clindamycin. Data Extraction and Synthesis Two reviewers independently assessed titles/abstracts and full-text articles, extracted data, and assessed study quality; when at least 3 similar studies were available, meta-analyses were conducted. Main Outcomes and Measures Sensitivity, specificity, preterm delivery, maternal adverse effects, congenital birth defects, childhood cancer. Results Forty-four studies (48 publications) were included. No studies evaluated the benefits or harms of screening. Twenty-five studies (n = 15 785) evaluated the accuracy of screening tests; across individual studies and tests, sensitivity ranged from 0.36 to 1.0 and specificity ranged from 0.49 to 1.0. Among trials reporting findings from general obstetric populations (n = 7953), no significant association was observed between treatment and spontaneous delivery before 37 weeks (pooled absolute risk difference [ARD], -1.44% [95% CI, -3.31% to 0.43%]; 8 RCTs, n = 7571) or any delivery before 37 weeks (pooled ARD, 0.20% [95% CI, -1.13% to 1.53%]; 6 RCTs, n = 6307). Among 5 trials reporting findings among women with a prior preterm delivery, findings were inconsistent; 3 showed a significant beneficial effect, while 2 did not. Maternal adverse events from treatment were infrequent and minor (eg, candidiasis) but were slightly more common with active treatment compared with placebo across 8 RCTs. Two meta-analyses of observational studies reported no significant association between metronidazole exposure and congenital malformations (odds ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.75 to 1.22]; odds ratio, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.90 to 1.29]). One cohort study reported no significantly increased incidence of childhood cancer among metronidazole-exposed children (adjusted relative risk, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.41 to 1.59]). However, studies of in utero exposure had important limitations. Conclusions and Relevance Accuracy of screening tests for bacterial vaginosis varies. The evidence suggests no difference in the incidence of preterm delivery and related outcomes from treatment for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in a general obstetric population but was inconclusive for women with a prior preterm delivery. Maternal adverse events from treatment appear to be infrequent and minor, but the evidence about harms from in utero exposure was inconclusive.","[Kahwati, Leila C.; Clark, Rachel; Berkman, Nancy; Urrutia, Rachel; Patel, Sheila V.; Zeng, Jennifer; Viswanathan, Meera] Univ N Carolina, RTI Int, Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Kahwati, Leila C.; Clark, Rachel; Berkman, Nancy; Patel, Sheila V.; Viswanathan, Meera] RTI Int, 3040 E Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Urrutia, Rachel] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Zeng, Jennifer] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Dept Family Med, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA",,"Kahwati, LC (corresponding author), RTI Int, 3040 E Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",Lkahwati@rti.org,,"Patel, Sheila/0000-0002-6508-8803; Berkman, Nancy/0000-0003-3617-1082; Kahwati, Leila/0000-0001-6963-2848","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Heath and Human Services [HHSA-290-2015-00011-I]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Heath and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA-290-2015-00011-I, Task Order 11, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Heath and Human Services, under a contract to support the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).",,69,7,7,0,1,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

We aimed to estimate the extent to which opioid prescribing after discharge affects self-reported pain intensity and adverse events in comparison with an opioid-free analgesic regimen. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, AMED, Biosis, and CINAHL from Jan 1, 1990, until July 8, 2021. We included multidose randomised controlled trials comparing opioid versus opioid-free analgesia in patients aged 15 years or older, discharged after undergoing a surgical procedure according to the Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the Enumeration of Mortality and Morbidity definition (minor, moderate, major, and major complex). We screened articles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias (Cochrane's risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials) in duplicate. The primary outcomes of interest were self-reported pain intensity on day 1 after discharge (standardised to 0-10 cm visual analogue scale) and vomiting up to 30 days. Pain intensity at further timepoints, pain interference, other adverse events, risk of dissatisfaction, and health-care reutilisation were also assessed. We did random-effects meta-analyses and appraised evidence certainty using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations scoring system. The review was registered with PROSPERO (ID CRD42020153050). Findings 47 trials (n=6607 patients) were included. 30 (64%) trials involved elective minor procedures (63% dental procedures) and 17 (36%) trials involved procedures of moderate extent (47% orthopaedic and 29% general surgery procedures). Compared with opioid-free analgesia, opioid prescribing did not reduce pain on the first day after discharge (weighted mean difference 0.01cm, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.27; moderate certainty) or at other postoperative timepoints (moderate-to-very-low certainty). Opioid prescribing was associated with increased risk of vomiting (relative risk 4.50, 95% CI 1.93 to 10.51; high certainty) and other adverse events, including nausea, constipation, dizziness, and drowsiness (high-to-moderate certainty). Opioids did not affect other outcomes. Interpretation Findings from this meta-analysis support that opioid prescribing at surgical discharge does not reduce pain intensity but does increase adverse events. Evidence relied on trials focused on elective surgeries of minor and moderate extent, suggesting that clinicians can consider prescribing opioid-free analgesia in these surgical settings. Data were largely derived from low-quality trials, and none involved patients having major or major-complex procedures. Given these limitations, there is a great need to advance the quality and scope of research in this field. Copyright (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

OBJECTIVE To search, review, and analyze long-term (>= 12 months) outcomes (symptoms, joint structure) from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of medications for knee osteoarthritis. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION The databases of MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched until June 30, 2018 (MEDLINE alerts through August 31, 2018) for RCTs of patients with knee osteoarthritis that had treatment and follow-up lasting 1 year or longer. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data at baseline and at the longest available treatment and follow-up of 12 months' duration or longer (or the change from baseline) were extracted. A Bayesian random-effects network meta-analysis was performed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the mean change from baseline in knee pain. Secondary outcomes were physical function and joint structure (the latter was measured radiologically as joint space narrowing). Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and mean differences with 95% credibility intervals (95% CrIs) were calculated. Findings were interpreted as associations when the 95% CrIs excluded the null value. RESULTS Forty-seven RCTs (22 037 patients; mean age range, mostly 55-70 years; and a higher mean proportion of women than men, around 70%) included the following medication categories: analgesics; antioxidants; bone-acting agents such as bisphosphonates and strontium ranelate; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; intra-articular injection medications such as hyaluronic acid and corticosteroids; symptomatic slow-acting drugs in osteoarthritis such as glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate; and putative disease-modifying agents such as cindunistat and sprifermin. Thirty-one interventions were studied for pain, 13 for physical function, and 16 for joint structure. Trial duration ranged from 1 to 4 years. Associations with decreases in pain were found for the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib (SMD,-0.18 [95% CrI,-0.35 to -0.01]) and the symptomatic slow-acting drug in osteoarthritis glucosamine sulfate (SMD,-0.29 [95% CrI,-0.49 to -0.09]), but there was large uncertainty for all estimates vs placebo. The association with pain improvement remained significant only for glucosamine sulfate when data were analyzed using the mean difference on a scale from 0 to 100 and when trials at high risk of bias were excluded. Associations with improvement in joint space narrowing were found for glucosamine sulfate (SMD,-0.42 [95% CrI,-0.65 to -0.19]), chondroitin sulfate (SMD,-0.20 [95% CrI, -0.31 to -0.07]), and strontium ranelate (SMD,-0.20 [95% CrI,-0.36 to -0.05]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this systematic review and network meta-analysis of studies of patients with knee osteoarthritis and at least 12 months of follow-up, there was uncertainty around the estimates of effect size for change in pain for all comparisons with placebo. Larger RCTs are needed to resolve the uncertainty around efficacy of medications for knee osteoarthritis.","[Gregori, Dario; Minto, Clara; Azzolina, Danila] Univ Padua, Dept Cardiac Thorac & Vasc Sci, Unit Biostat Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Padua, Italy; [Giacovelli, Giampaolo; Barbetta, Beatrice; Vaghi, Paola] Rottapharm Biotech, Dept Biostat, Monza, Italy; [Gualtieri, Francesca] Rottapharm Biotech, Sci Informat & Lib Serv, Monza, Italy; [Rovati, Lucio C.] Rottapharm Biotech, Dept Clin Res, Monza, Italy; [Rovati, Lucio C.] Univ Milano Bicocca, Sch Med & Surg, Via Cadore 48, I-20900 Monza, Italy",,"Rovati, LC (corresponding author), Univ Milano Bicocca, Sch Med & Surg, Via Cadore 48, I-20900 Monza, Italy.",lucio.rovati@unimib.it,"Azzolina, Danila/M-5100-2019","Azzolina, Danila/0000-0002-8185-5742; Rovati, Lucio/0000-0002-3425-1583",BIRD 2016 DCTV from the University of Padova; Rottapharm Biotech,BIRD 2016 DCTV from the University of Padova; Rottapharm Biotech,This study was supported by grant BIRD 2016 DCTV from the University of Padova and by financial support from Rottapharm Biotech.,,90,117,128,6,45,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

We aimed to estimate the benefit of thrombectomy overall and in prespecified subgroups through individual patient data meta-analysis. Methods We did a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis between Jan 1, 2010, and March 1, 2021, of randomised controlled trials of endovascular stroke therapy. In the Analysis Of Pooled Data From Randomized Studies Of Thrombectomy More Than 6 Hours After Last Known Well (AURORA) collaboration, the primary outcome was disability on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days, analysed by ordinal logistic regression. Key safety outcomes were symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage and mortality within 90 days. Findings Patient level data from 505 individuals (n=266 intervention, n=239 control; mean age 68.6 years [SD 13.7], 259 [51.3%] women) were included from six trials that met inclusion criteria of 17 screened published randomised trials. Primary outcome analysis showed a benefit of thrombectomy with an unadjusted common odds ratio (OR) of 2.42 (95% CI 1.76-3.33; p<0.0001) and an adjusted common OR (for age, gender, baseline stroke severity, extent of infarction on baseline head CT, and time from onset to random assignment) of 2.54 (1.83-3.54; p<0.0001). Thrombectomy was associated with higher rates of independence in activities of daily living (mRS 0-2) than best medical therapy alone (122 [45.9%] of 266 vs 46 [19.3%] of 238; p<0.0001). No significant difference between intervention and control groups was found when analysing either 90-day mortality (44 [16.5%] of 266 vs 46 [19.3%] of 238) or symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (14 [5.3%] of 266 vs eight [3.3%] of 239). No heterogeneity of treatment effect was noted across subgroups defined by age, gender, baseline stroke severity, vessel occlusion site, baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score, and mode of presentation; treatment effect was stronger in patients randomly assigned within 12-24 h (common OR 5.86 [95% CI 3.14-10.94]) than those randomly assigned within 6-12 h (1.76 [1.18-2.62]; p interaction=0.0087). Interpretation These findings strengthen the evidence for benefit of endovascular thrombectomy in patients with evidence of reversible cerebral ischaemia across the 6-24 h time window and are relevant to clinical practice. Our findings suggest that in these patients, thrombectomy should not be withheld on the basis of mode of presentation or of the point in time of presentation within the 6-24 h time window.

Cirrhosis develops after a long period of inflammation that results in replacement of the healthy liver parenchyma with fibrotic tissue and regenerative nodules, leading to portal hypertension. The disease evolves from an asymptomatic phase (compensated cirrhosis) to a symptomatic phase (decompensated cirrhosis), the complications of which often result in hospitalisation, impaired quality of life, and high mortality. Progressive portal hypertension, systemic inflammation, and liver failure drive disease outcomes. The management of liver cirrhosis is centred on the treatment of the causes and complications, and liver transplantation can be required in some cases. In this Seminar, we discuss the disease burden, pathophysiology, and recommendations for the diagnosis and management of cirrhosis and its complications. Future challenges include better screening for early fibrosis or cirrhosis, early identification and reversal of causative factors, and prevention of complications.","[Gines, Pere; Sola, Elsa] Hosp Clin Barcelona, Liver Unit, Barcelona 08036, Spain; [Gines, Pere; Sola, Elsa; Fabrellas, Nuria] Univ Barcelona, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Barcelona, Spain; [Gines, Pere; Fabrellas, Nuria] Inst Biomed Invest August Pi & Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain; [Gines, Pere; Fabrellas, Nuria] Hepat & Digest Dis Biomed Invest Ctr, Madrid, Spain; [Krag, Aleksander] Odense Univ Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Liver Res Ctr, Odense, Denmark; [Krag, Aleksander] Univ Southern Denmark, Inst Clin Res, Odense, Denmark; [Abraldes, Juan G.] Univ Alberta, Div Gastroenterol, Liver Unit, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Sola, Elsa] Stanford Univ, Inst Immun Transplantat & Infect, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kamath, Patrick S.] Mayo Clin, Coll Med & Sci, Rochester, MN USA",,"Gines, P (corresponding author), Hosp Clin Barcelona, Liver Unit, Barcelona 08036, Spain.",pgines@clinic.cat,,"Krag, Aleksander/0000-0002-9598-4932",ISCIII-Subdireccion General de Evaluacion; European Regional Development Fund; Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Hepaticas y Digestivas; Agency for Management of University [AGAUR 2017_SGR_01281]; National Institutes of Health's National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [U01AA26974]; FIS [18/01330]; LiverHope [731875]; LiverScreen [847989],ISCIII-Subdireccion General de Evaluacion; European Regional Development Fund(European Commission); Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Hepaticas y Digestivas; Agency for Management of University; National Institutes of Health's National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism; FIS(Instituto de Salud Carlos III); LiverHope; LiverScreen,"We dedicate this work to the memories of Prof Juan Rodes and Robert W Schier.

In 2014.28.7% of community-dwelling adults 65 years or older reported falling, resulting in 29 million falls (37.5% of which needed medical treatment or restricted activity for a day or longer) and an estimated 33 000 deaths in 2015. OBJECTIVE To update the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on the prevention of falls in community-dwelling older adults. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness and harms of primary care-relevant interventions to prevent falls and fall-related morbidity and mortality in community-dwelling older adults 65 years or older who are not known to have osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency. FINDINGS The USPSTF found adequate evidence that exercise interventions have a moderate benefit in preventing falls in older adults at increased risk for falls and that multifactorial interventions have a small benefit. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that vitamin D supplementation has no benefit in preventing falls in older adults. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the harms of exercise and multifactorial interventions as no greater than small. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the overall harms of vitamin D supplementation are small to moderate. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF recommends exercise interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are at increased risk for falls. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer multifactorial interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are at increased risk for falls. Existing evidence indicates that the overall net benefit of routinely offering multifactorial interventions to prevent falls is small. When determining whether this service is appropriate for an individual, patients and clinicians should consider the balance of benefits and harms based on the circumstances of prior falls, presence of comorbid medical conditions, and the patient's values and preferences. (C recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older. (D recommendation) These recommendations apply to community-dwelling adults who are not known to have osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency.","[Grossman, David C.] Kaiser Permanente, Washington Hlth Res Inst, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Curry, Susan J.] Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA USA; [Owens, Douglas K.] Vet Affairs Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Palo Alto, CA USA; [Owens, Douglas K.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Barry, Michael] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA USA; [Caughey, Aaron B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Davidson, Karina W.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA; [Doubeni, Chyke A.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Epling, John W., Jr.] Virginia Tech, Carilion Sch Med, Roanoke, VA USA; [Kemper, Alex R.] Nationwide Childrens Hosp, Columbus, OH USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Fairfax Family Practice Residency, Fairfax, VA USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Kubik, Martha] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Landefeld, Seth] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL USA; [Mangione, Carol M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Pignone, Michael] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Silverstein, Michael] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Simon, Melissa A.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Univ Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Pacific Hlth Res & Educ Inst, Honolulu, HI USA",,"Grossman, DC (corresponding author), Kaiser Permanente, Washington Hlth Res Inst, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",chair@uspstf.net,"Epling, John W/J-1097-2019; Davidson, Karina/AAG-2388-2019","Epling, John W/0000-0001-9445-8669; Davidson, Karina/0000-0002-9162-477X; Kemper, Alex/0000-0001-5491-3997",Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ),Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality),"The USPSTF is an independent, voluntary body.

There is uncertainty regarding optimal diagnostic criteria, definitions for malnutrition, and how to identify patients who would benefit from nutritional intervention. Malnutrition has become the focus of research aimed at translating current knowledge of its pathophysiology into improved diagnosis and treatment. Researchers are particularly interested in developing nutritional interventions that reverse the negative effects of disease-related malnutrition in the hospital setting. High-quality randomised trials have provided evidence that nutritional therapy can reduce morbidity and other complications associated with malnutrition in some patients. Screening of patients for risk of malnutrition at hospital admission, followed by nutritional assessment and individualised nutritional interventions for malnourished patients, should become part of routine clinical care and multimodal treatment in hospitals worldwide.","[Schuetz, Philipp] Univ Dept Med, Div Gen Internal & Emergency Med, Aarau, Switzerland; [Kaegi-Braun, Nina] Div Diabet Endocrinol Nutr Med & Metab, Aarau, Switzerland; [Kaegi-Braun, Nina] Kantonsspital Aarau, Aarau, Switzerland; [Schuetz, Philipp] Univ Basel, Fac Med, Basel, Switzerland; [Seres, David] Columbia Univ, Irving Med Ctr, Dept Med, New York, NY USA; [Seres, David] Columbia Univ, Irving Med Ctr, Inst Human Nutr, New York, NY USA; [Lobo, Dileep N.] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Digest Dis Ctr, Nottingham, England; [Lobo, Dileep N.] Nottingham Univ Hosp NHS Trust, Sch Life Sci, MRC Versus Arthrit Ctr Res, Queens Med Ctr, Nottingham, England; [Lobo, Dileep N.] Nottingham Univ Hosp NHS Trust, Natl Inst Hlth Res, Nottingham Biomed Res Ctr, Nottingham, England; [Lobo, Dileep N.] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham, England; [Gomes, Filomena] Nutr Sci Program, New York Acad Sci, New York, NY USA; [Gomes, Filomena] Univ Nova Lisboa, NOVA Med Sch, Lisbon, Portugal; [Stanga, Zeno] Univ Bern, Univ Hosp Bern, Div Diabet Endocrinol Nutrit Med & Metab, Bern, Switzerland",,"Schuetz, P (corresponding author), Kantonsspital Aarau, Univ Dept Med, Div Gen Internal & Emergency Med, CH-5001 Aarau, Switzerland.",schuetzph@gmail.com,"Schuetz, Philipp/C-8475-2013","Schuetz, Philipp/0000-0001-6400-4949; Kaegi-Braun, Nina/0000-0003-4015-295X; Lobo, Dileep N/0000-0003-1187-5796","Swiss National Science Foundation [PP00P3_150531]; Research Committee of the Kantonsspital Aarau [1410.000.058, 1410.000.044]; Nestle Health Science; Abbott Nutrition; Fresenius Kabi; B Braun",Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); Research Committee of the Kantonsspital Aarau; Nestle Health Science(Nestle SA); Abbott Nutrition(Abbott Laboratories); Fresenius Kabi; B Braun,"PS reports grants from the Swiss National Science Foundation (PP00P3_150531), the Research Committee of the Kantonsspital Aarau (1410.000.058 and 1410.000.044), Nestle Health Science, and Abbott Nutrition.

Current sepsis guidelines do not provide guidance on posthospital care or recovery. OBSERVATIONS Each year, more than 19 million individuals develop sepsis, defined as a life-threatening acute organ dysfunction secondary to infection. Approximately 14 million survive to hospital discharge and their prognosis varies. Half of patients recover, one-third die during the following year, and one-sixth have severe persistent impairments. Impairments include development of an average of 1 to 2 new functional limitations (eg, inability to bathe or dress independently), a 3-fold increase in prevalence of moderate to severe cognitive impairment (from 6.1% before hospitalization to 16.7% after hospitalization), and a high prevalence of mental health problems, including anxiety (32% of patients who survive), depression (29%), or posttraumatic stress disorder (44%). About 40% of patients are rehospitalized within 90 days of discharge, often for conditions that are potentially treatable in the outpatient setting, such as infection (11.9%) and exacerbation of heart failure (5.5%). Compared with patients hospitalized for other diagnoses, those who survive sepsis (11.9%) are at increased risk of recurrent infection than matched patients (8.0%) matched patients (P < .001), acute renal failure (3.3% vs 1.2%, P < .001), and new cardiovascular events (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] range, 1.1-1.4). Reasons for deterioration of health after sepsis are multifactorial and include accelerated progression of preexisting chronic conditions, residual organ damage, and impaired immune function. Characteristics associated with complications after hospital discharge for sepsis treatment are not fully understood but include both poorer presepsis health status, characteristics of the acute septic episode (eg, severity of infection, host response to infection), and quality of hospital treatment (eg, timeliness of initial sepsis care, avoidance of treatment-related harms). Although there is a paucity of clinical trial evidence to support specific postdischarge rehabilitation treatment, experts recommend referral to physical therapy to improve exercise capacity, strength, and independent completion of activities of daily living. This recommendation is supported by an observational study involving 30 000 sepsis survivors that found that referral to rehabilitation within 90 days was associated with lower risk of 10-year mortality compared with propensity-matched controls (adjusted HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92-0.97, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In the months after hospital discharge for sepsis, management should focus on (1) identifying new physical, mental, and cognitive problems and referring for appropriate treatment, (2) reviewing and adjusting long-term medications, and (3) evaluating for treatable conditions that commonly result in hospitalization, such as infection, heart failure, renal failure, and aspiration. For patients with poor or declining health prior to sepsis who experience further deterioration after sepsis, it may be appropriate to focus on palliation of symptoms.","[Prescott, Hallie C.] Univ Michigan, Dept Internal Med, 2800 Plymouth Rd,North Campus Res Ctr,Bldg 16, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Prescott, Hallie C.] Univ Michigan, Inst Healthcare Policy & Innovat, 2800 Plymouth Rd,North Campus Res Ctr,Bldg 16, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Prescott, Hallie C.] VA Ctr Clin Management Res, Hlth Serv Res & Dev Ctr Innovat, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Angus, Derek C.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Crit Care Med, Clin Res Invest & Syst Modeling Acute Illness CRI, Pittsburgh, PA USA",,"Prescott, HC (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Internal Med, 2800 Plymouth Rd,North Campus Res Ctr,Bldg 16, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Prescott, HC (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Inst Healthcare Policy & Innovat, 2800 Plymouth Rd,North Campus Res Ctr,Bldg 16, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",hprescot@med.umich.edu,"Angus, Derek C/E-9671-2012","Prescott, Hallie/0000-0002-8442-6724","National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health [K08 GM115859, R01 GM097471]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES [K08GM115859, R01GM097471] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)),This work was supported by grants K08 GM115859 (Dr Prescott) and R01 GM097471 (Dr Angus) from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health.,,94,315,329,7,115,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Scientific advances from the past 5 years suggest that scabies is amenable to population-level control, particularly through mass drug administration. In recognition of these issues, WHO added scabies to the list of neglected tropical diseases in 2017. To develop a global control programme, key operational research questions must now be addressed. Standardised approaches to diagnosis and methods for mapping are required to further understand the burden of disease. The safety of treatments for young children, including with ivermectin and moxidectin, should be investigated. Studies are needed to inform optimum implementation of mass treatment, including the threshold for intervention, target, dosing, and frequency.

OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects associated with LAMA vs placebo or vs other controllers as an add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids and the use of a LAMA as add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs; hereafter referred to as triple therapy) vs inhaled corticosteroids and LABA in patients with uncontrolled, persistent asthma. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane databases, and clinical trial registries date through November 28, 2017). STUDY SELECTION Two reviewers selected randomized clinical trials or observational studies evaluating a LAMA vs placebo or vs another controller as an add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids or triple therapy vs inhaled corticosteroids and LABA in patients with uncontrolled, persistent asthma reporting on an outcome of interest. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Meta-analyses using a random-effects model was conducted to calculate risk ratios (RR5), risk differences (RD5), and mean differences (MDs) with corresponding 95% Cls. Citation screening, data abstraction, risk assessment, and strength-of-evidence grading were completed by 2 independent reviewers. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Asthma exacerbations. RESULTS Of 1326 records identified, 15 randomized clinical trials (N = 7122 patients) were included. Most trials assessed adding LAMA vs placebo or LAMA vs LABA to inhaled corticosteroids. Adding LAMA vs placebo to inhaled corticosteroids was associated with a significantly reduced risk of exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids (RR, 0.67 [95% Cl, 0.48 to 0.92]; RD,-0.02 [95% Cl,-0.04 to 0.00]). Compared with adding LABA, adding LAMA to inhaled corticosteroids was not associated with significant improvements in exacerbation risk (RR, 0.87 [95% Cl, 0.53 to 142]; RD, 0.00 [95% Cl,-0.02 to 0.02]), or any other outcomes of interest. Triple therapy was not significantly associated with improved exacerbation risk vs inhaled corticosteroids and LABA (RR, 0.84 [95% Cl, 037 to 1.22]; RD,-0.01 [95% Cl,-0.08 to 0.07]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the use of LAMA compared with placebo as add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids was associated with a lower risk of asthma exacerbations; however, the association of LAMA with benefit may not be greater than that with LABA. Triple therapy was not associated with a lower risk of exacerbations.","[Sobieraj, Diana M.; Baker, William L.; Nguyen, Elaine; Weeda, Erin R.; Coleman, Craig I.; White, C.

Colorectal cancer is most frequently diagnosed among persons aged 65 to 74 years. It is estimated that 10.5% of new colorectal cancer cases occur in persons younger than 50 years. Incidence of colorectal cancer (specifically adenocarcinoma) in adults aged 40 to 49 years has increased by almost 15% from 2000-2002 to 2014-2016. In 2016, 26% of eligible adults in the US had never been screened for colorectal cancer and in 2018, 31% were not up to date with screening. ObjectiveTo update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for colorectal cancer in adults 40 years or older. The review also examined whether these findings varied by age, sex, or race/ethnicity. In addition, as in 2016, the USPSTF commissioned a report from the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network Colorectal Cancer Working Group to provide information from comparative modeling on how estimated life-years gained, colorectal cancer cases averted, and colorectal cancer deaths averted vary by different starting and stopping ages for various screening strategies. PopulationAsymptomatic adults 45 years or older at average risk of colorectal cancer (ie, no prior diagnosis of colorectal cancer, adenomatous polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease; no personal diagnosis or family history of known genetic disorders that predispose them to a high lifetime risk of colorectal cancer [such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis]). Evidence AssessmentThe USPSTF concludes with high certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 75 years has substantial net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 45 to 49 years has moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years who have been previously screened has small net benefit. Adults who have never been screened for colorectal cancer are more likely to benefit. RecommendationThe USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer in all adults aged 50 to 75 years. (A recommendation) The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 45 to 49 years. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years. Evidence indicates that the net benefit of screening all persons in this age group is small. In determining whether this service is appropriate in individual cases, patients and clinicians should consider the patient's overall health, prior screening history, and preferences. (C recommendation) This 2021 Recommendation Statement from the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for colorectal cancer in all adults aged 50 to 75 years (A recommendation), screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 45 to 49 years (B recommendation), and that clinicians selectively offer screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years (C recommendation).","[Davidson, Karina W.] Northwell Hlth, Feinstein Inst Med Res, Manhasset, NY USA; [Barry, Michael J.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Mangione, Carol M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Cabana, Michael] Albert Einstein Coll Med, New York, NY USA; [Caughey, Aaron B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Davis, Esa M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Donahue, Katrina E.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Doubeni, Chyke A.] Mayo Clin, Rochester, MN USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Fairfax Family Practice Residency, Fairfax, VA USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Kubik, Martha] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Li, Li] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Ogedegbe, Gbenga] NYU, New York, NY USA; [Owens, Douglas K.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pbert, Lori] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Worcester, MA USA; [Silverstein, Michael] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Univ Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Pacific Hlth Res & Educ Inst, Honolulu, HI USA; [Wong, John B.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Stevermer, James] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO USA",,"Davidson, KW (corresponding author), Feinstein Inst Med Res, 130 E 59th St,Ste 14C, New York, NY 10032 USA.",chair@uspstf.net,,,Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ),Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality),"The USPSTF is an independent, voluntary body.

In this Series paper, we aim to do the following: examine mentions of a physical activity legacy in pre-Olympic bid documentation; analyse existing physical activity surveillance data collected before, during, and after the Olympic Games in hosting areas around the world; and evaluate Google Trends data surrounding the London 2012 Olympic Games as a case study of community interest in the topic of exercise during the time of the Olympic Games. Before 2007, little mention of physical activity was made in pre-Olympic Games documentation, but, after that, most documents had targets for population physical activity or sports participation. The synthesis of available surveillance data indicates that there was no change in the prevalence of physical activity or sports participation, except for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano; although, the increase in participation in Nagano might not be attributable to the Olympic Games since there was no change in participation in winter sports. The Google Trends data showed an acute spike in searches with the term Olympic immediately associated with the London Olympic Games period and showed a sustained peri-Olympic increase in searches with the term exercise. By themselves, the Olympic Games have not improved population-wide physical activity but might be an important missed public health opportunity. Such a legacy will require strategic planning and partnerships across the International Olympic Committee and the Olympic, sport, and public health agencies and a thorough evaluation framework implemented throughout the pre-Olympic Games and post-Olympic Games period in the host country.","[Bauman, Adrian E.; Ding, Ding] Univ Sydney, Sch Publ Hlth, Prevent Res Collaborat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Kamada, Masamitsu] Univ Tokyo, Sch Publ Hlth, Grad Sch Med, Tokyo, Japan; [Reis, Rodrigo S.] Washington Univ St Louis, Brown Sch, Prevent Res Ctr, St Louis, MO USA; [Reis, Rodrigo S.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Parana, Urban Management, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Troiano, Richard P.] NCI, Div Canc Control & Populat Sci, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Milton, Karen] Univ East Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Murphy, Niamh] Waterford Inst Technol, Sport & Exercise Sci, Hlth Sci, Waterford, Ireland; [Hallal, Pedro C.] Univ Fed Pelotas, Postgrad Program Epidemiol, Pelotas, RS, Brazil",,"Bauman, AE (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Publ Hlth, Prevent Res Collaborat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",adrian.bauman@sydney.edu.au,"Kamada, Masamitsu/H-4411-2011","Kamada, Masamitsu/0000-0003-1703-076X; Milton, Karen/0000-0002-0506-2214; Murphy, Niamh/0000-0002-0176-2897",,,,,78,11,11,22,49,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,JUL 31,2021,398,10298,,,,,456,464,,10.1016/S0140-6736(21)01165-X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)01165-X,,JUL 2021,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,TS1BS,34302766,Green Accepted,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000679392600027,View Full Record in Web of Science,29605,1,36,6,40,67,74,56,31,9,75,24,56,9,14,34,16

Substantial demands are placed upon modern implants, because patients expect to remain active for longer. We discuss the advances made in implant performance and the developments in perioperative practice that have reduced complications. Assessment of surgery outcomes should include patient-reported outcome measures and implant survival rates that are based on data from joint replacement registries.

Nonoperative treatment includes analgesia, antibiotics for 7 to 10 days, and careful follow-up. With surgery, appendicitis cannot recur, and the incidence of subsequent hospitalization is lower than with nonoperative treatment. Surgery requires general anesthesia and in most instances an overnight hospital stay. Nonoperative treatment is associated with a shorter duration of disability than appendectomy, does not routinely require hospitalization, and is not associated with an increased risk of rupture. Over 5 years, approximately 30 to 40% of patients who had been treated with antibiotics will undergo appendectomy, although rates vary with patient characteristics and practice patterns. Patients with appendicolith who receive nonoperative treatment are more likely than those without an appendicolith to undergo appendectomy. Patients should be informed of the advantages and disadvantages of both strategies and should participate in decision making. Nonoperative Antibiotic Treatment of Acute Appendicitis Treatment for acute uncomplicated appendicitis may involve appendectomy or nonoperative care (pain control, antibiotics, and careful follow-up). The advantages and disadvantages of each should be discussed with the patient. Over 5 years, 30 to 40% of patients who received antibiotics will undergo appendectomy, although the range may vary, depending on patient characteristics and practice patterns.","[Talan, David A.] UCLA Ronald Reagan Med Ctr, Dept Emergency Med, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Talan, David A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Di Saverio, Salomone] Hosp San Benedetto Tronto, Dept Gen Surg, ASUR Marche, San Benedetto Tronto, Italy",,"Talan, DA (corresponding author), UCLA, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Emergency Med, 924 Westwood Blvd,Ste 300, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",dtalan@ucla.edu,"Di Saverio, Salomone/G-1437-2012","Di Saverio, Salomone/0000-0001-5685-5022",,,,,46,6,6,3,8,MASSACHUSETTS MEDICAL SOC,WALTHAM,"WALTHAM WOODS CENTER, 860 WINTER ST,, WALTHAM, MA 02451-1413 USA",0028-4793,1533-4406,,NEW ENGL J MED,N.

The clinical presentation of SLE is heterogeneous, can involve one or more organs, including the skin, kidneys, joints, and nervous system, and take a chronic or relapsing and remitting disease course. SLE is most common in women and in those of non-white ethnicity. Because of the multitude of presentations, manifestations, and serological abnormalities in patients with SLE, diagnosis can be challenging. Therapeutic approaches predominantly involve immunomodulation and immunosuppression and are targeted to the specific organ manifestation, with the aim of achieving low disease activity. Despite many treatment advances and improved diagnostics, SLE continues to cause substantial morbidity and premature mortality. Current management strategies, although helpful, are limited by high failure rates and toxicity. An overreliance on corticosteroid therapy contributes to much of the long-term organ damage. In this Seminar, we outline the classification criteria for SLE, current treatment strategies and medications, the evidence supporting their use, and explore potential future therapies.","[Durcan, Laura] Beaumont Hosp, Dept Rheumatol, POB 1297, Dublin, Ireland; [Durcan, Laura] Royal Coll Surgeons Ireland, Dept Med, Dublin, Ireland; [O'Dwyer, Tom] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Physiotherapy, Dublin, Ireland; [Petri, Michelle] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Div Rheumatol, Baltimore, MA USA",,"Durcan, L (corresponding author), Beaumont Hosp, Dept Rheumatol, POB 1297, Dublin, Ireland.",lauradurcan@beaumont.ie,"O'Dwyer, Tom/Y-3012-2019","O'Dwyer, Tom/0000-0002-8072-4783",,,,,161,137,159,14,49,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,JUN 8,2019,393,10188,,,,,2332,2343,,10.1016/S0140-6736(19)30237-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(19)30237-5,,,12,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,IB4SX,31180030,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000470263400031,View Full Record in Web of Science,29958,1,73,136,17,152,6,51,67,106,99,76,6,80,14,160,143

NAFLD encompasses a disease continuum from steatosis with or without mild inflammation (non-alcoholic fatty liver), to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is characterised by necroinflammation and faster fibrosis progression than non-alcoholic fatty liver. NAFLD has a bidirectional association with components of the metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes increases the risk of cirrhosis and related complications. Although the leading causes of death in people with NAFLD are cardiovascular disease and extrahepatic malignancy, advanced liver fibrosis is a key prognostic marker for liver-related outcomes and overall mortality, and can be assessed with combinations of non-invasive tests. Patients with cirrhosis should be screened for hepatocellular carcinoma and oesophageal varices. There is currently no approved therapy for NAFLD, although several drugs are in advanced stages of development. Because of the complex pathophysiology and substantial heterogeneity of disease phenotypes, combination treatment is likely to be required for many patients with NAFLD. Healthy lifestyle and weight reduction remain crucial to the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.","[Powell, Elizabeth E.] Univ Queensland, Translat Res Inst, Fac Med, Ctr Liver Dis Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Powell, Elizabeth E.] Princess Alexandra Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Brisbane, Qld 4102, Australia; [Wong, Vincent Wai-Sun] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Med & Therapeut, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wong, Vincent Wai-Sun] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, State Key Lab Digest Dis, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Rinella, Mary] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA",,"Powell, EE (corresponding author), Princess Alexandra Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Brisbane, Qld 4102, Australia.",e.powell@uq.edu.au,,,,,,,142,101,102,111,143,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,JUN 5,2021,397,10290,,,,,2212,2224,,10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32511-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32511-3,,JUN 2021,13,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,SM8DI,33894145,,Y,Y,2022-07-11,WOS:000657828600027,View Full Record in Web of Science,30577,1,28,40,126,45,131,15,21,52,39,118,113,89,43,48,12

However, through rapid global nutrition transition, an increasing proportion of individuals are exposed to different forms of malnutrition during the life course and have the double burden of malnutrition (DBM) directly. Long-lasting effects of malnutrition in early life can be attributed to interconnected biological pathways, involving imbalance of the gut microbiome, inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, and impaired insulin signalling. Life-course exposure to early undernutrition followed by later overweight increases the risk of non-communicable disease, by imposing a high metabolic load on a depleted capacity for homoeostasis, and in women increases the risk of childbirth complications. These life-course trajectories are shaped both by societal driving factors-ie, rapidly changing diets, norms of eating, and physical activity patterns-and by broader ecological factors such as pathogen burden and extrinsic mortality risk. Mitigation of the DBM will require major societal shifts regarding nutrition and public health, to implement comprehensive change that is sustained over decades, and scaled up into the entire global food system.","[Wells, Jonathan C.; Poullas, Marios S.] UCL Great Ormond St Inst Child Hlth, Childhood Nutr Res Ctr, London, England; [Sawaya, Ana Lydia] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Dept Physiol, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Wibaek, Rasmus] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Nutr Exercise & Sports, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Demaio, Alessandro] Univ Copenhagen, Sch Global Hlth, Dept Publ Hlth, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Wibaek, Rasmus] Steno Diabet Ctr Copenhagen, Clin Epidemiol, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Mwangome, Martha] Kenya Govt Med Res Ctr, Wellcome Trust Res Program, Kilifi, Kenya; [Yajnik, Chittaranjan S.] KEM Hosp & Res Ctr, Diabet Unit, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Demaio, Alessandro] EAT Fdn, Oslo, Norway; [Demaio, Alessandro] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Demaio, Alessandro] VicHealth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,"Wells, JC (corresponding author), UCL Great Ormond St Inst Child Hlth, Populat Policy & Practice Res & Teaching Programm, Childhood Nutr Res Ctr, London WC1N 1EH, England.",jonathan.wells@ucl.ac.uk,"Mwangome, Martha/AFO-0988-2022; Sawaya, Ana Lydia/D-3845-2014","Mwangome, Martha/0000-0003-4806-1307; Sawaya, Ana Lydia/0000-0002-2580-9557; Wibaek, Rasmus/0000-0002-4989-2084; Demaio, Alessandro/0000-0002-1767-4576",WHO; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,WHO(World Health Organization); Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationCGIAR),"Funding for the preparation of the Series was provided by WHO, through a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

With that aim, the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response has developed a chronology of events, actions, and recommendations, from December, 2019, when the first cases of COVID-19 were identified in China, to the end of March, 2020, by which time the outbreak had spread extensively worldwide and had been characterised as a pandemic. Datapoints are based on two literature reviews, WHO documents and correspondence, submissions to the Panel, and an expert verification process. The retrospective analysis of the chronology shows a dedicated initial response by WHO and some national governments, but also aspects of the response that could have been quicker, including outbreak notifications under the International Health Regulations (IHR), presumption and confirmation of human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and, most importantly, the public health response of many national governments. The chronology also shows that some countries, largely those with previous experience with similar outbreaks, reacted quickly, even ahead of WHO alerts, and were more successful in initially containing the virus. Mapping actions against IHR obligations, the chronology shows where efficiency and accountability could be improved at local, national, and international levels to more quickly alert and contain health threats in the future. In particular, these improvements include necessary reforms to international law and governance for pandemic preparedness and response, including the IHR and a potential framework convention on pandemic preparedness and response.","[Singh, Sudhvir; Bristol, Nellie; Bergstrom, Elin; Bartos, Michael; Mabuchi, Shunsuke; Panjabi, Raj; Abdalla, Salma M.; Bonk, Mathias; Werner, George K.; Nordstrom, Anders; Legido-Quigley, Helena; Phelan, Alexandra] Independent Panel Pandem Preparedness & Response, CH-1218 Geneva, Switzerland; [Singh, Sudhvir] Univ Auckland, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Olson, Rose McKeon; Nolan, Cody; Karan, Abraar] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bartos, Michael] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Sociol, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Jamieson, Margaret] Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Legido-Quigley, Helena] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London, England; [Legido-Quigley, Helena] Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, Singapore, Singapore; [Phelan, Alexandra] Georgetown Univ, Ctr Global Hlth Sci & Secur, Washington, DC USA; [Abdalla, Salma M.] Boston Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA USA",,"Singh, S (corresponding author), Independent Panel Pandem Preparedness & Response, CH-1218 Geneva, Switzerland.",singhsu@ipppr.org,"Karan, Abraar/AAD-7967-2022","Singh, Sudhvir/0000-0002-9915-6755",Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response,Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response,Data for the study was collected under the auspices of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response.

Although the outlook for patients with SLE has greatly improved, many unmet needs remain, chief of which is the development of safer and more efficacious therapies. To develop innovative therapies, a far better understanding of SLE pathogenesis as it relates to the array of clinical phenotypes is needed. Additionally, to efficiently achieve these goals, the lupus community needs to refine existing clinical research tools and better adapt them to overcome the obstacles created by the heterogeneity of manifestations. Here, we review progress towards the ultimate goal of safely reducing disease activity and preventing damage accrual and death. We discuss the new classification criteria from the European League Against Rheumatism and American College of Rheumatology, novel definitions of remission and low lupus disease activity, and new proposals for the histological classification of lupus nephritis. Recommendations for the treatment of SLE and novel approaches to drug development hold much promise to further enhance SLE outcomes.","[Doerner, Thomas] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Dept Med, Charitepl 01, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Doerner, Thomas] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Dept Rheumatol & Clin Immunol, Charitepl 01, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Doerner, Thomas] German Rheumatism Res Ctr DRFZ, Berlin, Germany; [Furie, Richard] Northwell Hlth & Zucker Sch Med Hofstra Northwell, Div Rheumatol, Great Neck, NY USA",,"Dorner, T (corresponding author), Charite Univ Med Berlin, Dept Med, Charitepl 01, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.;Dorner, T (corresponding author), Charite Univ Med Berlin, Dept Rheumatol & Clin Immunol, Charitepl 01, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",thomas.doerner@charite.de,,,,,,,110,169,179,16,63,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,JUN 8,2019,393,10188,,,,,2344,2358,,10.1016/S0140-6736(19)30546-X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(19)30546-X,,,15,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,IB4SX,31180031,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000470263400032,View Full Record in Web of Science,31623,1,39,85,36,21,29,52,22,24,95,79,100,10,27,46,33

Intervention is also required in three later phases: the middle childhood growth and consolidation phase (5-9 years), when infection and malnutrition constrain growth, and mortality is higher than previously recognised; the adolescent growth spurt (10-14 years), when substantial changes place commensurate demands on good diet and health; and the adolescent phase of growth and consolidation (15-19 years), when new responses are needed to support brain maturation, intense social engagement, and emotional control. Two cost-efficient packages, one delivered through schools and one focusing on later adolescence, would provide phase-specific support across the life cycle, securing the gains of investment in the first 1000 days, enabling substantial catch-up from early growth failure, and leveraging improved learning from concomitant education investments.","[Bundy, Donald A.

J,"Pevsner, J",,,,"Pevsner, Jonathan",,,Leonardo da Vinci's studies of the brain,LANCET,,,English,Review,,,,,,,,"Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) contributed to the study of the nervous system. His earliest surviving anatomical drawings (circa 1485-93) included studies of the skull, brain, and cerebral ventricles. These works reflected his efforts to understand medieval psychology, including the localisation of sensory and motor functions to the brain. He was also the first to pith a frog, concluding that piercing the spinal medulla causes immediate death. After a 10-year interval in the early 1500s Leonardo resumed his anatomical studies and developed a method to inject hot wax into the ventricular system, creating a cast that showed the shape and extent of the ventricles. During this period he also progressed in his understanding of the anatomy of the cranial nerves. Besides being the first to identify the olfactory nerve as a cranial nerve, his dissections showed him that contrary to previous theories, the nerves do not converge on the lateral or third ventricles. Leonardo also performed detailed studies of the peripheral nervous system. Although his discoveries had little influence on the development of the field of anatomy, they represent an astonishingly sharp break from the field that had seen little if any progress in the previous 13 centuries. His work reflects the emergence of the modern scientific era and forms a key part of his integrative approach to art and science.","[Pevsner, Jonathan] Kennedy Krieger Inst, Dept Neurol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA",,"Pevsner, J (corresponding author), Kennedy Krieger Inst, Dept Neurol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",pevsner@kennedykrieger.org,,,,,,,40,6,6,1,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,APR 6,2019,393,10179,,,,,1465,1472,,10.1016/S0140-6736(19)30302-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(19)30302-2,,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,HS0OU,30967217,,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000463561000031,View Full Record in Web of Science,31920,1,23,17,39,33,38,2,27,30,11,15,14,18,9,26,36

ObjectiveTo update the 2014 HBV screening review in nonpregnant adolescents and adults to inform the USPSTF. Data SourcesCochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Ovid MEDLINE (2014 to August 2019); with surveillance through July 24, 2020. Study SelectionRandomized clinical trials (RCTs) on screening and antiviral therapy; cohort studies on screening, antiviral therapy clinical outcomes, and the association between achieving intermediate outcomes after antiviral therapy and clinical outcomes. Data Extraction and SynthesisOne investigator abstracted data; a second investigator checked accuracy. Two investigators independently assessed study quality. Random-effects profile likelihood meta-analysis was performed. ResultsThirty trials and 20 cohort studies, with a total of 94168 participants, were included. No study directly evaluated the effects of screening for HBV infection vs no screening on clinical outcomes such as mortality, hepatocellular carcinoma, or cirrhosis. Screening strategies that focused on risk factors such as ever having immigrated from high-prevalence countries and demographic and behavioral risk factors would identify nearly all HBV infection cases. In 1 study (n=21008), only screening immigrants from high-prevalence countries would miss approximately two-thirds of infected persons. Based on 18 trials (n=2972), antiviral therapy compared with placebo or no treatment was associated with greater likelihood of achieving intermediate outcomes, such as virologic suppression and hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) or hepatitis B surface antigen loss or seroconversion; the numbers needed to treat ranged from 2.6 for virologic suppression to 17 for HBeAg seroconversion. Based on 12 trials (n=4127), first-line antiviral therapies were at least as likely as nonpreferred therapies to achieve intermediate outcomes. Based on 16 trials (n=4809), antiviral therapy might be associated with improved clinical outcomes, but data were sparse and imprecise. Nine cohort studies (n=3893) indicated an association between achieving an intermediate outcome following antiviral therapy and improved clinical outcomes but were heterogeneous (hazard ratios ranged from 0.07 to 0.87). Antiviral therapy was associated with higher risk of withdrawal due to adverse events vs placebo or no antiviral therapy. Conclusions and RelevanceThere was no direct evidence for the clinical benefits and harms of HBV screening vs no screening. Antiviral therapy for HBV infection was associated with improved intermediate outcomes and may improve clinical outcomes. This systematic review to support the 2020 US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement on screening for hepatitis B virus infection summarizes published evidence on the benefits and harms of screening and interventions for hepatitis B infection in nonpregnant adolescents and adults.","[Chou, Roger; Blazina, Ian; Bougatsos, Christina; Holmes, Rebecca; Selph, Shelley; Grusing, Sara; Jou, Janice] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Northwest Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Dept Med Informat & Clin Epidemiol, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Chou, Roger] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Div Gen Internal Med & Geriatr, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Selph, Shelley] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Family Med, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Jou, Janice] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Portland, OR 97201 USA",,"Chou, R (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd,Mail Code BICC, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",chour@ohsu.edu,,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA290201500009-I, 038-606-014]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA290201500009-I, Project ID 038-606-014, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).",,85,8,8,1,5,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease accounts for 3.2% of all physician office visits annually and is the fourth leading cause of death (126 000 deaths per year). Most patients are diagnosed by their primary care clinicians who must address the highly variable clinical features and responses to therapy. The diagnosis and treatment of COPD is rapidly changing, so understanding recent advances is important for the delivery of optimal patient care. OBSERVATIONS Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by incompletely reversible expiratory airflow limitation. Spirometry is the reference standard for diagnosing and assessing the severity of COPD. All patients should be counseled about and receive preventive measures such as smoking cessation and vaccination. Treatment should be guided by the severity of lung impairment, symptoms such as dyspnea, the amount of cough and sputum production, and how often a patient experiences an exacerbation. When dyspnea limits activity or quality of life, COPD should be treated with once- or twice-daily maintenance long-acting anticholinergic and beta-agonist bronchodilators. Patients with acute exacerbations may benefit from the addition of inhaled corticosteroids, particularly those with elevated peripheral eosinophil levels. Pulmonary rehabilitation, which includes strength and endurance training and educational, nutritional, and psychosocial support, improves symptoms and exercise tolerance but is underutilized. Supplemental oxygen for patients with resting hypoxemia (defined as SpO(2) <89%) improves survival. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a complicated disease requiring intensive treatment. Appropriate use of long-acting maintenance bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, and pulmonary rehabilitation decreases symptoms, optimizes functional performance, and reduces exacerbation frequency. Supplemental oxygen in patients with resting hypoxemia prolongs life, and other advanced treatments are available based on specific patient characteristics.","[Riley, Craig M.; Sciurba, Frank C.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Med Allergy & Crit Care Med, Div Pulm, Pittsburgh, PA USA",,"Sciurba, FC (corresponding author), Kaufmann Bldg,Ste 1211,3471 Fifth Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",sciurbafc@upmc.edu,"Sciurba, Frank/AAZ-9339-2021",,,,,,90,80,92,2,19,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

An estimated annual 480000 deaths are attributable to tobacco use in adults, including from secondhand smoke. It is estimated that every day about 1600 youth aged 12 to 17 years smoke their first cigarette and that about 5.6 million adolescents alive today will die prematurely from a smoking-related illness. Although conventional cigarette use has gradually declined among children in the US since the late 1990s, tobacco use via electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) is quickly rising and is now more common among youth than cigarette smoking. e-Cigarette products usually contain nicotine, which is addictive, raising concerns about e-cigarette use and nicotine addiction in children. Exposure to nicotine during adolescence can harm the developing brain, which may affect brain function and cognition, attention, and mood; thus, minimizing nicotine exposure from any tobacco product in youth is important. Objective To update its 2013 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on the benefits and harms of primary care interventions for tobacco use prevention and cessation in children and adolescents. The current systematic review newly included e-cigarettes as a tobacco product. Population This recommendation applies to school-aged children and adolescents younger than 18 years. Evidence Assessment The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that primary care-feasible behavioral interventions, including education or brief counseling, to prevent tobacco use in school-aged children and adolescents have a moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes that there is insufficient evidence to determine the balance of benefits and harms of primary care interventions for tobacco cessation among school-aged children and adolescents who already smoke, because of a lack of adequately powered studies on behavioral counseling interventions and a lack of studies on medications. Recommendation The USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians provide interventions, including education or brief counseling, to prevent initiation of tobacco use among school-aged children and adolescents. (B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of primary care-feasible interventions for the cessation of tobacco use among school-aged children and adolescents. (I statement) This 2020 Recommendation Statement from the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that primary care clinicians provide interventions, including education or brief counseling, to prevent initiation of tobacco use among school-aged children and adolescents (B recommendation) and concludes that current evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of primary care interventions for cessation of tobacco use among school-aged children and adolescents (I statement).",,,,,,"Epling, John W/0000-0001-9445-8669",Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ),Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality),"The USPSTF is an independent, voluntary body.

We estimated summary mean treatment differences and odds ratios using network meta-analyses with random effects. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018087106. Findings Studies were published between Jan 1, 1994 and Aug 1, 2017, in which 1992 potential studies were screened for inclusion. This analysis is based on 89 trials, which included 25 441 patients randomly assigned to 22 different active drugs or placebo. Duloxetine (MD -3.13, 95% credible interval [CrI] -4.13 to -2.13), pregabalin (MD -2.79, 95% CrI -3.69 to -1.91), venlafaxine (MD -2.69, 95% CrI -3.50 to -1.89), and escitalopram (MD -2.45, 95% CrI -3.27 to -1.63) were more efficacious than placebo with relatively good acceptability. Mirtazapine, sertraline, fluoxetine, buspirone, and agomelatine were also found to be efficacious and well tolerated but these findings were limited by small sample sizes. Quetiapine (MD -3.60 95% CrI -4.83 to -2.39) had the largest effect on HAM-A but it was poorly tolerated (odds ratio 1.44, 95% CrI 1.16-1.80) when compared with placebo. Likewise, paroxetine and benzodiazepines were effective but also poorly tolerated when compared with placebo. Risk of reporting bias was considered low, and when possible all completed studies were included to avoid publication bias. Interpretation To our knowledge, this is the largest contemporary review of pharmacological agents for the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder by use of network analysis. There are several effective treatment choices for generalised anxiety disorder across classes of medication. The failure of initial pharmacological therapy might not be a reason to abandon a pharmacological treatment strategy. Funding No funding was received for this research.

Nowadays, it is the world's fourth most deadly cancer with almost 900 000 deaths annually. Besides an ageing population and dietary habits of high-income countries, unfavourable risk factors such as obesity, lack of physical exercise, and smoking increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Advancements in pathophysiological understanding have increased the array of treatment options for local and advanced disease leading to individual treatment plans. Treatments include endoscopic and surgical local excision, downstaging preoperative radiotherapy and systemic therapy, extensive surgery for locoregional and metastatic disease, local ablative therapies for metastases, and palliative chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Although these new treatment options have doubled overall survival for advanced disease to 3 years, survival is still best for those with non-metastasised disease. As the disease only becomes symptomatic at an advanced stage, worldwide organised screening programmes are being implemented, which aim to increase early detection and reduce morbidity and mortality from colorectal cancer.","[Dekker, Evelien; Vleugels, Jasper L.

We first comprehensively reviewed the peer-reviewed and grey literature for rigorously evaluated programmes that aimed to reduce gender inequality and restrictive gender norms and improve health. We identified four mutually reinforcing factors underpinning change: (1) multisectoral action, (2) multilevel, multistakeholder involvement, (3) diversified programming, and (4) social participation and empowerment. Following this review, because little research has investigated the effects of national-level law and policy reforms, we conducted original quasi-experimental studies on laws and policies related to education, work, and income, all social determinants of health in which deep gender inequalities exist. We examined whether the laws and policies significantly affected health outcomes and gender norms, and whether law-induced and policy-induced changes in gender norms mediated the health effects, in areas for which longitudinal data existed. Laws and policies that made primary education tuitionfree (13 intervention countries with the law and/or policy and ten control countries without) and that provided paid maternity and parental leave (seven intervention and 15 control countries) significantly improved women's and their children's health (odds ratios [OR] of 1.16-2.10, depending on health outcome) and gender equality in household decision making (OR 1.46 for tuition-free and 1.45 for paid maternity and parental leave) as a proxy indicator of gender norms. Increased equality partially mediated the positive effects on health outcomes. We conclude by discussing examples of how improved governance can support gender-equitable laws, policies, and programmes, immediate next steps, and future research needs.","[Heymann, Jody; Bose, Bijetri; Rios-Salas, Vanessa; Omidakhsh, Negar; Gadoth, Adva; Huh, Kate; Heymann, Jody] Univ Calif Los Angeles, WORLD Policy Anal Ctr, Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Levy, Jessica K.] Washington Univ, Brown Sch, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Mekonen, Yehualashet] African Child Policy Forum, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Swaminathan, Hema] Indian Inst Management Bangalore, Ctr Publ Policy, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Greene, Margaret E.] GreeneWorks, Washington, DC USA; [Darmstadt, Gary L.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Darmstadt, Gary L.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Populat Hlth Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,"Heymann, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, WORLD Policy Anal Ctr, Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",jody.heymann@ph.ucla.edu,"Hawkes, Sarah/AAK-7375-2020; Heise, LORI/AAI-6251-2020; Darmstadt, Gary/AAU-7488-2020","Heymann, Jody/0000-0003-0008-4198; Bose, Bijetri/0000-0001-6239-7566; Darmstadt, Gary/0000-0002-7522-5824; Gadoth, Adva/0000-0002-3217-2435","Gender Equality, Integrated Delivery, HIV, Nutrition, Family Planning, and Water Sanitation and Hygiene Program Strategy Teams at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; United Arab Emirates Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation; William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; Conrad N Hilton Foundation","Gender Equality, Integrated Delivery, HIV, Nutrition, Family Planning, and Water Sanitation and Hygiene Program Strategy Teams at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; United Arab Emirates Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation; William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; Conrad N Hilton Foundation","The work of the Series was funded by the Gender Equality, Integrated Delivery, HIV, Nutrition, Family Planning, and Water Sanitation and Hygiene Program Strategy Teams at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the United Arab Emirates Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, through grants to Stanford University.

Consequently, the protection of noncombatants and the provision of humanitarian services must continually adapt to this changing conflict environment. Complex political affiliations, the systematic use of explosive weapons and sexual violence, and the use of new communication technology, including social media, have created new challenges for humanitarian actors in negotiating access to affected populations and security for their own personnel. The nature of combatants has also evolved as armed, non-state actors might have varying motivations, use different forms of violence, and engage in a variety of criminal activities to generate requisite funds. New health threats, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and new capabilities, such as modern trauma care, have also created new challenges and opportunities for humanitarian health provision. In response, humanitarian policies and practices must develop negotiation and safety capabilities, informed by political and security realities on the ground, and guidance from affected communities. More fundamentally, humanitarian policies will need to confront a changing geopolitical environment, in which traditional humanitarian norms and protections might encounter wavering support in the years to come.","[Wise, Paul H.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wise, Paul H.; Bendavid, Eran; Barry, Michele] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Innovat Global Hlth, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bendavid, Eran; Barry, Michele] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wise, Paul H.; Shiel, Annie; Southard, Nicole; Bendavid, Eran; Stedman, Stephen; Barry, Michele] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Shiel, Annie] Ctr Civilians Conflict, Washington, DC USA; [Welsh, Jennifer] McGill Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Fazal, Tanisha] Univ Minnesota, Dept Polit Sci, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Felbab-Brown, Vanda] Brookings Inst, Foreign Policy Program, Initiat Nonstate Armed Actors, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Polatty, David] US Naval War Coll, Civilian Military Humanitarian Response Program, Newport, RI USA; [Waldman, Ronald J.] George Washington Univ, Milken Inst Sch Publ Hlth, Washington, DC USA; [Spiegel, Paul B.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Humanitarian Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Spiegel, Paul B.; Black, Robert] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Blanchet, Karl] Univ Geneva, Geneva Ctr Educ & Res Humanitarian Act, Geneva, Switzerland; [Blanchet, Karl] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Hlth & Humanitarian Crises Ctr, London, England; [Dayoub, Rita] Chatham House, Ctr Global Hlth Secur, London, England; [Zakayo, Aliyu] Amer Univ Nigeria, Yola, Nigeria; [Garcia, Daniel Martinez] Med Sans Frontieres, Geneva, Switzerland; [Pagano, Heather] Med Sans Frontieres, Brussels, Belgium; [Gaffey, Michelle F.; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.] Hosp Sick Children, Ctr Global Child Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Gaffey, Michelle F.; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.] Aga Khan Univ, Ctr Excellence Women & Child Hlth, Karachi, Pakistan; [Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.] Aga Khan Univ, Inst Global Hlth & Dev, Karachi, Pakistan",,"Wise, PH (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",pwise@stanford.edu,"Spiegel, Paul/AAL-3238-2021; Bhutta, Zulfiqar/L-7822-2015","Bhutta, Zulfiqar/0000-0003-0637-599X",,,,,88,11,11,1,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,FEB 6,2021,397,10273,,,,,511,521,,10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00130-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00130-6,,FEB 2021,11,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),General & Internal Medicine,QF1LZ,33503458,Bronze,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000616661900027,View Full Record in Web of Science,33404,1,73,60,45,16,3,81,57,7,1,31,4,1,56,25,53

Furthermore, sophisticated techniques for assessing myocardial damage have evolved during the past 50 years. It is therefore not surprising that an association between acute infections and myocardial infarction has been appreciated only in the past few decades.

The aim of this Review is to provide a summary of knowledge on placebo controls in surgical trials. A placebo control is a complex type of comparison group in the surgical setting and, although powerful, presents many challenges. This Review outlines what a placebo control entails and present understanding of this tool in the context of surgery. We consider when placebo controls in surgery are acceptable (and when they are desirable) in terms of ethical arguments and regulatory requirements, how a placebo control should be designed, how to identify and mitigate risk for participants in these trials, and how such trials should be done and interpreted. Use of placebo controls is justified in randomised controlled trials of surgical interventions provided there is a strong scientific and ethical rationale. Surgical placebos might be most appropriate when there is poor evidence for the efficacy of the procedure and a justified concern that results of a trial would be associated with high risk of bias, particularly because of the placebo effect. Feasibility work is recommended to optimise the design and implementation of randomised controlled trials.

The prevalence of AAA has declined over the past 2 decades among screened men 65 years or older in various European countries. The current prevalence of AAA in the United States is unclear because of the low uptake of screening. Most AAAs are asymptomatic until they rupture. Although the risk for rupture varies greatly by aneurysm size, the associated risk for death with rupture is as high as 81%. OBJECTIVE To update its 2014 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on the effectiveness of 1-time and repeated screening for AAA, the associated harms of screening, and the benefits and harms of available treatments for small AAAs (3.0-5.4 cm in diameter) identified through screening. POPULATION This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults 50 years or older. However, the randomized trial evidence focuses almost entirely on men aged 65 to 75 years. EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT Based on a review of the evidence, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for AAA in men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked is of moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for AAA in men aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked is of small net benefit. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the net benefit of screening for AAA in women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of screening for AAA in women aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked and have no family history of AAA outweigh the benefits. RECOMMENDATIONS The USPSTF recommends 1-time screening for AAA with ultrasonography in men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer screening for AAA with ultrasonography in men aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked rather than routinely screening all men in this group. (C recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against routine screening for AAA with ultrasonography in women who have never smoked and have no family history of AAA. (D recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AAA with ultrasonography in women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA.

Acne vulgaris can cause permanent physical scarring, negatively affect quality of life and self-image, and has been associated with increased rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation. ObservationsAcne vulgaris is classified based on patient age, lesion morphology (comedonal, inflammatory, mixed, nodulocystic), distribution (location on face, trunk, or both), and severity (extent, presence or absence of scarring, postinflammatory erythema, or hyperpigmentation). Although most acne does not require specific medical evaluation, medical workup is sometimes warranted. Topical therapies such as retinoids (eg, tretinoin, adapalene), benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, and/or combinations of topical agents are first-line treatments. When prescribed as a single therapy in a randomized trial of 207 patients, treatment with tretinoin 0.025% gel reduced acne lesion counts at 12 weeks by 63% compared with baseline. Combinations of topical agents with systemic agents (oral antibiotics such as doxycycline and minocycline, hormonal therapies such as combination oral contraception [COC] or spironolactone, or isotretinoin) are recommended for more severe disease. In a meta-analysis of 32 randomized clinical trials, COC was associated with reductions in inflammatory lesions by 62%, placebo was associated with a 26% reduction, and oral antibiotics were associated with a 58% reduction at 6-month follow-up. Isotretinoin is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating severe recalcitrant nodular acne but is often used to treat resistant or persistent moderate to severe acne, as well as acne that produces scarring or significant psychosocial distress. Conclusions and RelevanceAcne vulgaris affects approximately 9% of the population worldwide and approximately 85% of those aged 12 to 24 years. First-line therapies are topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, or combinations of topicals. For more severe disease, oral antibiotics such as doxycycline or minocycline, hormonal therapies such as combination oral conceptive agents or spironolactone, or isotretinoin are most effective. This review summarizes the characteristics of comedonal, inflammatory, and nodulocystic acne and describes current methods of treatment.","[Eichenfield, Dawn Z.; Sprague, Jessica; Eichenfield, Lawrence F.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, La Jolla, CA 92123 USA; [Eichenfield, Dawn Z.; Sprague, Jessica; Eichenfield, Lawrence F.] Rady Childrens Hosp, Div Pediat & Adolescent Dermatol, San Diego, CA 92123 USA; [Eichenfield, Lawrence F.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, La Jolla, CA 92123 USA",,"Eichenfield, LF (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, 3020 Childrens Way,Mail Code 5092, San Diego, CA 92123 USA.;Eichenfield, LF (corresponding author), Rady Childrens Hosp, 3020 Childrens Way,Mail Code 5092, San Diego, CA 92123 USA.",leichenfield@rchsd.org,,,,,,,111,4,4,21,29,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

It is acquired at birth or later via person-to-person transmission. Vaccination effectively prevents infection and chronic hepatitis B virus carriage. In chronically infected patients, an elevated serum hepatitis B virus DNA concentration is the main risk factor for disease progression, although there are other clinical and viral parameters that influence disease outcomes. In addition to liver biochemistry, virological markers, and abdominal ultrasonography, non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis is emerging as an important assessment modality. Long-term nucleos(t)ide-analogue therapy is safe and well tolerated, achieves potent viral suppression, and reduces the incidence of liver-related complications. However, a need to optimise management remains. Promising novel therapies are at the developmental stage. With current vaccines, therapies, and an emphasis on improving linkage to care, WHO's goal of eliminating hepatitis B virus as a global health threat by 2030 is achievable.","[Seto, Wai-Kay; Yuen, Man-Fung] Univ Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hosp, Dept Med, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Seto, Wai-Kay; Yuen, Man-Fung] Univ Hong Kong, Shenzhen Hosp, Dept Med, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Seto, Wai-Kay; Yuen, Man-Fung] Univ Hong Kong, Lab Liver Res, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lo, Ying-Ru] WHO Representat Off Malaysia Brunei Darussalam &, Cyberjaya, Malaysia; [Pawlotsky, Jean-Michel] Univ Paris Est, Henri Mondor Hosp, Dept Virol, Natl Reference Ctr Viral Hepatitis B C & Delta, Creteil, France; [Pawlotsky, Jean-Michel] INSERM, U955, Dept Mol Virol & Immunol, Creteil, France",,"Yuen, MF (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hosp, Dept Med, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",mfyuen@hkucc.hku.hk,"SETO, Wai-Kay/H-4452-2012","SETO, Wai-Kay/0000-0002-9012-313X",Abbott; Gilead Sciences; Bristol-Myers Squibb,Abbott(Abbott Laboratories); Gilead Sciences(Gilead Sciences); Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb),"W-KS is an advisory board member of Gilead Sciences and Bristol-Myers Squibb, and has received speaker's fees from AbbVie, Gilead Sciences, and Bristol-Myers Squibb.

Importance Interventions to discourage the use of tobacco products (including electronic nicotine delivery systems or e-cigarettes) among children and adolescents may help decrease tobacco-related illness and injury. Objective To update the 2013 review on primary care-relevant interventions for tobacco use prevention and cessation in children and adolescents to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force. Data Sources The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, PsyINFO, and EMBASE (September 1, 2012, to June 25, 2019), with surveillance through February 7, 2020. Study Selection Primary care-relevant studies; randomized clinical trials and nonrandomized controlled intervention studies of children and adolescents up to age 18 years for cessation and age 25 years for prevention. Trials comparing behavioral or pharmacological interventions with no or a minimal tobacco use intervention control group (eg, usual care, attention control, wait list) were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis One investigator abstracted data and a second investigator checked data abstraction for accuracy. Two investigators independently assessed study quality. Studies were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures Tobacco use initiation; tobacco use cessation; health outcomes; harms. Results Twenty-four randomized clinical trials (N = 44521) met inclusion criteria. Behavioral interventions were associated with decreased likelihood of cigarette smoking initiation compared with control interventions at 7 to 36 months' follow-up (13 trials, n = 21700; 7.4% vs 9.2%; relative risk [RR], 0.82 [95% CI, 0.73-0.92]). There was no statistically significant difference between behavioral interventions and controls in smoking cessation when trials were restricted to smokers (9 trials, n = 2516; 80.7% vs 84.1% continued smoking; RR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.93-1.01]). There were no significant benefits of medication on likelihood of smoking cessation in 2 trials of bupropion at 26 weeks (n = 523; 17% [300 mg] and 6% [150 mg] vs 10% [placebo]; 24% [150 mg] vs 28% [placebo]) and 1 trial of nicotine replacement therapy at 12 months (n = 257; 8.1% vs 8.2%). One trial each (n = 2586 and n = 1645) found no beneficial intervention effect on health outcomes or on adult smoking. No trials of prevention in young adults were identified. Few trials addressed prevention or cessation of tobacco products other than cigarettes; no trials evaluated effects of interventions on e-cigarette use. There were few trials of pharmacotherapy, and they had small sample sizes. Conclusions and Relevance Behavioral interventions may reduce the likelihood of smoking initiation in nonsmoking children and adolescents.

Even so, the system of HIV care and prevention services in the USA is a complex patchwork of payers, providers, and financing mechanisms. People with HIV are primarily covered by Medicaid, Medicare, private insurance, or a combination of these; many get care through other programmes, particularly the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, which serves as the nation's safety net for people with HIV who remain uninsured or underinsured but offers modest to no support for prevention services. While uninsurance has drastically declined over the past decade, the USA trails other high-income countries in key HIV-specific metrics, including rates of viral suppression. In this paper in the Series, we provide an overview of the coverage and financing landscape for HIV treatment and prevention in the USA, discuss how the Affordable Care Act has changed the domestic health-care system, examine the major programmes that provide coverage and services, and identify remaining challenges.","[Kates, Jennifer; Dawson, Lindsey] Henry J Kaiser Family Fdn, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Horn, Tim H.; Killelea, Amy] Natl Alliance State & Terr AIDS Directors NASTAD, Washington, DC USA; [McCann, Nicole C.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Med, Med Practice Evaluat Ctr, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Crowley, Jeffrey S.] Georgetown Univ, ONeill Inst Natl & Global Hlth Law, Washington, DC USA; [Walensky, Rochelle P.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Div Infect Dis, Boston, MA 02114 USA",,"Kates, J (corresponding author), Henry J Kaiser Family Fdn, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",jkates@kff.org,,,,,,,59,9,9,3,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,MAR 20,2021,397,10279,,,,,1127,1138,,10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00397-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00397-4,,MAR 2021,12,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),General & Internal Medicine,QZ0AN,33617778,,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000630397800030,View Full Record in Web of Science,34486,1,41,3,24,12,11,44,1,39,52,52,55,8,46,51,39

For patients with NCDs, being uninsured is associated with 2-7-fold higher odds of catastrophic levels of out-of-pocket costs; however, the protection offered by health insurance is often incomplete. To enable coverage of the predictable and long-term costs of treatment, national programmes to extend financial protection should be based on schemes that entail compulsory enrolment or be financed through taxation. Priority should be given to eliminating financial barriers to the uptake of and adherence to interventions that are cost-effective and are designed to help the poor.

The disorder affects people of all ages and ethnicities, has a substantial psychosocial impact on patients and relatives, and is the leading cause of the global burden from skin disease. Atopic dermatitis is associated with increased risk of multiple comorbidities, including food allergy, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and mental health disorders. The pathophysiology is complex and involves a strong genetic predisposition, epidermal dysfunction, and T-cell driven inflammation. Although type-2 mechanisms are dominant, there is increasing evidence that the disorder involves multiple immune pathways. Currently, there is no cure, but increasing numbers of innovative and targeted therapies hold promise for achieving disease control, including in patients with recalcitrant disease.

Given the link between kidney disease and cancer development and treatment, the aim of this Review is to highlight the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration between oncologists and nephrologists to predict and prevent chemotherapeutic-induced nephrotoxicity.

Globally, ARDS accounts for 10% of intensive care unit admissions, representing more than 3 million patients with ARDS annually. OBJECTIVE To review advances in diagnosis and treatment of ARDS over the last 5 years. EVIDENCE REVIEW We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2012 to 2017 focusing on randomized clinical trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and clinical practice guidelines. Articles were identified for full text review with manual review of bibliographies generating additional references. FINDINGS After screening 1662 citations, 31 articles detailing major advances in the diagnosis or treatment of ARDS were selected. The Berlin definition proposed 3 categories of ARDS based on the severity of hypoxemia: mild (200 mm Hg<PaO2/FIO2 <= 300 mm Hg), moderate (100 mm Hg<PaO2/FIO2 <= 200 mm Hg), and severe (PaO2/FIO2 <= 100 mm Hg), along with explicit criteria related to timing of the syndrome's onset, origin of edema, and the chest radiograph findings. The Berlin definition has significantly greater predictive validity for mortality than the prior American-European Consensus Conference definition. Clinician interpretation of the origin of edema and chest radiograph criteria may be less reliable in making a diagnosis of ARDS. The cornerstone of management remains mechanical ventilation, with a goal to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Aspirin was not effective in preventing ARDS in patients at high-risk for the syndrome. Adjunctive interventions to further minimize VILI, such as prone positioning in patients with a PaO2/FIO2 ratio less than 150 mm Hg, were associated with a significant mortality benefit whereas others (eg, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal) remain experimental. Pharmacologic therapies such as beta(2) agonists, statins, and keratinocyte growth factor, which targeted pathophysiologic alterations in ARDS, were not beneficial and demonstrated possible harm. Recent guidelines on mechanical ventilation in ARDS provide evidence-based recommendations related to 6 interventions, including low tidal volume and inspiratory pressure ventilation, prone positioning, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, higher vs lower positive end-expiratory pressure, lung recruitment maneuvers, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The Berlin definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome addressed limitations of the American-European Consensus Conference definition, but poor reliability of some criteria may contribute to underrecognition by clinicians. No pharmacologic treatments aimed at the underlying pathology have been shown to be effective, and management remains supportive with lung-protective mechanical ventilation. Guidelines on mechanical ventilation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome can assist clinicians in delivering evidence-based interventions that may lead to improved outcomes.","[Fan, Eddy; Slutsky, Arthur S.] Univ Toronto, Interdept Div Crit Care Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Fan, Eddy] Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Fan, Eddy] Univ Hlth Network, Dept Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Fan, Eddy] Sinai Hlth Syst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Fan, Eddy; Slutsky, Arthur S.] Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Brodie, Daniel] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, New York Presbyterian Hosp, Div Pulm Allergy & Crit Care Med, New York, NY USA; [Slutsky, Arthur S.] St Michaels Hosp, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Inst, Keenan Res Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada",,"Fan, E (corresponding author), Toronto Gen Hosp, 585 Univ Ave,PMB 11-123, Toronto, ON M5G 2N2, Canada.",eddy.fan@uhn.ca,"Slutsky, Arthur/M-3325-2019",,Canadian Institutes of Health Research,Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),Dr Fan is supported by a New Investigator Award from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.,,97,552,630,16,133,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Modelling estimated the effect of cocaine and amphetamine use on mortality, suicidality, and blood borne virus incidence. The estimated global prevalence of cocaine use was 0.4% and amphetamine use was 0.7%, with dependence affecting 16% of people who used cocaine and 11% of those who used amphetamine. Stimulant use was associated with elevated mortality, increased incidence of HIV and hepatitis C infection, poor mental health (suicidality, psychosis, depression, and violence), and increased risk of cardiovascular events. No effective pharmacotherapies are available that reduce stimulant use, and the available psychosocial interventions (except for contingency management) had a weak overall effect. Generic approaches can address mental health and blood borne virus infection risk if better tailored to mitigate the harms associated with stimulant use. Substantial and sustained investment is needed to develop more effective interventions to reduce stimulant use.","[Farrell, Michael; Stockings, Emily; Degenhardt, Louisa; Tran, Lucy Thi; McKetin, Rebecca] Univ New South Wales Sydney, Natl Drug & Alcohol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia;

The prevalence of PAH is approximately 10.6 cases per 1 million adults in the US. Untreated, PAH progresses to right heart failure and death. OBSERVATIONS Pulmonary hypertension is defined by a mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 20 mm Hg and is classified into 5 clinical groups based on etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is 1 of the 5 groups of PH and is hemodynamically defined by right heart catheterization demonstrating a mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 20 mm Hg, a pulmonary artery wedge pressure of 15 mm Hg or lower, and a pulmonary vascular resistance of 3 Wood units or greater. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is further divided into subgroups based on underlying etiology, consisting of idiopathic PAH, heritable PAH, drug- and toxin-associated PAH, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, PAH in long-term responders to calcium channel blockers, and persistent PH of the newborn, as well as PAH associated with other medical conditions including connective tissue disease, HIV, and congenital heart disease. Early presenting symptoms are nonspecific and typically consist of dyspnea on exertion and fatigue. Currently approved therapy for PAH consists of drugs that enhance the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate biological pathway (sildenafil, tadalafil, or riociguat), prostacyclin pathway agonists (epoprostenol or treprostinil), and endothelin pathway antagonists (bosentan and ambrisentan). With these PAH-specific therapies, 5-year survival has improved from 34% in 1991 to more than 60% in 2015. Current treatment consists of combination drug therapy that targets more than 1 biological pathway, such as the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate and endothelin pathways (eg, ambrisentan and tadalafil), and has shown demonstrable improvement in morbidity and mortality compared with the previous conventional single-pathway targeted monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Pulmonary arterial hypertension affects an estimated 10.6 per 1 million adults in the US and, without treatment, typically progresses to right heart failure and death, First-line therapy with drug combinations that target multiple biological pathways are associated with improved survival.","[Ruopp, Nicole F.] Tufts Med Ctr, Pulm Crit Care & Sleep Med, 800 Washington St,257, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Cockrill, Barbara A.] Harvard Med Sch, Pulm & Crit Care Med, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,"Ruopp, NF (corresponding author), Tufts Med Ctr, Pulm Crit Care & Sleep Med, 800 Washington St,257, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",nruopp@tuftsmedicalcenter.org,,,,,,,99,2,2,10,10,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments are available; however, because of inadequate resources, antidepressants are used more frequently than psychological interventions. Prescription of these agents should be informed by the best available evidence. Therefore, we aimed to update and expand our previous work to compare and rank antidepressants for the acute treatment of adults with unipolar major depressive disorder. Methods We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis. We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS database, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, PsycINFO, the websites of regulatory agencies, and international registers for published and unpublished, double-blind, randomised controlled trials from their inception to Jan 8, 2016. We included placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials of 21 antidepressants used for the acute treatment of adults (>= 1.8 years old and of both sexes) with major depressive disorder diagnosed according to standard operationalised criteria. We excluded quasi-randomised trials and trials that were incomplete or included 20% or more of participants with bipolar disorder, psychotic depression, or treatment-resistant depression; or patients with a serious concomitant medical illness. We extracted data following a predefined hierarchy. In network meta-analysis, we used group-level data. We assessed the studies' risk of bias in accordance to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Primary outcomes were efficacy (response rate) and acceptability (treatment discontinuations due to any cause). We estimated summary odds ratios (ORs) using pairwise and network meta-analysis with random effects. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42012002291. Findings We identified 28 552 citations and of these included 522 trials comprising 116 477 participants. In terms of efficacy, all antidepressants were more effective than placebo, with ORs ranging between 2.13 (95% credible interval [CH] 1.89-2.41) for amitriptyline and 1.37 (1.16-1.63) for reboxetine. For acceptability, only agomelatine (OR 0.84, 95% CrI 0.72-0.97) and fluoxetine (0.88, 0.80-0.96) were associated with fewer dropouts than placebo, whereas clomipramine was worse than placebo (1.30, 1.01-1.68). When all trials were considered, differences in ORs between antidepressants ranged from 1.15 to 1.55 for efficacy and from 0.64 to 0.83 for acceptability, with wide CrIs on most of the comparative analyses. In head-to-head studies, agomelatine, amitriptyline, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and vortioxetine were more effective than other antidepressants (range of ORs 1.19-1.96), whereas fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, reboxetine, and trazodone were the least efficacious drugs (0.51-0.84). For acceptability, agomelatine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, and vortioxetine were more tolerable than other antidepressants (range of ORs 0.43-0.77), whereas amitriptyline, clomipramine, duloxetine, fluvoxamine, reboxetine, trazodone, and venlafaxine had the highest dropout rates (1.30-2.32). 46 (9%) of 522 trials were rated as high risk of bias, 380 (73%) trials as moderate, and 96 (18%) as low; and the certainty of evidence was moderate to very low. Interpretation All antidepressants were more efficacious than placebo in adults with major depressive disorder. Smaller differences between active drugs were found when placebo-controlled trials were included in the analysis, whereas there was more variability in efficacy and acceptability in head-to-head trials. These results should serve evidence-based practice and inform patients, physicians, guideline developers, and policy makers on the relative merits of the different antidepressants.

OBJECTIVE To propose iterative changes to US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) processes, methods, and recommendations and enact a commitment to eliminate health inequities for people affected by systemic racism. DESIGN AND EVIDENCE In February 2021, the USPSTF began operational steps in its work to create preventive care recommendations to address the harmful effects of racism. A commissioned methods report was conducted to inform this process. Key findings of the report informed proposed updates to the USPSTF methods to address populations adversely affected by systemic racism and proposed pilots on implementation of the proposed changes. FINDINGS The USPSTF proposes to consider the opportunity to reduce health inequities when selecting new preventive care topics and prioritizing current topics; seek evidence about the effects of systemic racism and health inequities in all research plans and public comments requested, and integrate available evidence into evidence reviews; and summarize the likely effects of systemic racism and health inequities on clinical preventive services in USPSTF recommendations. The USPSTF will elicit feedback from its partners and experts and proposed changes will be piloted on selected USPSTF topics. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The USPSTF has developed strategies intended to mitigate the influence of systemic racism in its recommendations. The USPSTF seeks to reduce health inequities and other effects of systemic racism through iterative changes in methods of developing evidence-based recommendations, with partner and public input in the activities to implement the advancements.","[Davidson, Karina W.] Feinstein Inst Med Res Northwell Hlth, 130 E 59th St,Ste 14C, New York, NY 10022 USA; [Mangione, Carol M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Barry, Michael J.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Cabana, Michael D.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, New York, NY USA; [Caughey, Aaron B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Davis, Esa M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Donahue, Katrina E.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Doubeni, Chyke A.] Mayo Clin, Rochester, MN USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Fairfax Family Practice Residency, Fairfax, VA USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, VA USA; [Kubik, Martha] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Li, Li] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Ogedegbe, Gbenga] NYU, Grossman Sch Med, New York, NY USA; [Pbert, Lori] Univ Massachusetts, Med Sch, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Silverstein, Michael] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Simon, Melissa] Northwestern Univ, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Stevermer, James] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Univ Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Pacific Hlth Res & Educ Inst, Honolulu, HI USA; [Wong, John B.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02111 USA",,"Davidson, KW (corresponding author), Feinstein Inst Med Res Northwell Hlth, 130 E 59th St,Ste 14C, New York, NY 10022 USA.",kdavidson2@northwell.edu,,,Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ),Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality),"The USPSTF is an independent, voluntary body.

OBJECTIVE To review the evidence on screening and interventions for IPV, elder abuse, and abuse of vulnerable adults to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and trial registries through October 4, 2017; references; experts; literature surveillance through August 1, 2018. STUDY SELECTION English-language randomized clinical trials (RCTs), studies evaluating test accuracy, and cohort studies with a concurrent control group assessing harms. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Dual review of titles and abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality; qualitative synthesis of findings. Data were not pooled, primarily because of heterogeneity of populations, interventions, and outcomes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Abuse or neglect, morbidity caused by abuse, test accuracy, and harms. RESULTS Thirty studies were included (N = 14 959). Three RCTs (n = 3759) compared IPV screening with no screening; none found significant improvements in outcomes (eg, IPV or quality of life) over 3 to 18 months and 2 (n = 935) reported no harms of screening. Nine studies assessed tools to detect any past-year or current IPV in women; for past-year IPV (5 studies [n = 6331]), sensitivity of 5 tools ranged from 65% to 87% and specificity ranged from 80% to 95%. The accuracy of 5 tools (4 studies [n = 1795]) for detecting current abuse varied widely; sensitivity ranged from 46% to 94% and specificity ranged from 38% to 95%. Eleven RCTs (n = 6740) evaluated interventions for women with screen-detected IPV. Two enrolling pregnant women (n = 575) found significantly less IPV among women in the intervention group: 1 home visiting intervention (standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.34 [95% CI, -0.59 to -0.08]) and 1 behavioral counseling intervention for multiple risks (IPV, smoking, depression, tobacco exposure) (SMD, -0.40 [95% CI, -0.68 to -0.12]). No studies evaluated screening or interventions for elder abuse or abuse of vulnerable adults. One study assessing a screening tool for elder abuse had poor accuracy (sensitivity, 46% and specificity, 73% for detecting physical or verbal abuse). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although available screening tools may reasonably identify women experiencing IPV, trials of IPV screening in adult women did not show a reduction in IPV or improvement in quality of life over 3 to 18 months. Limited evidence suggested that home visiting and behavioral counseling interventions that address multiple risk factors may lead to reduced IPV among pregnant or postpartum women. No studies assessed screening or treatment for elder abuse and abuse of vulnerable adults.","[Feltner, Cynthia; Wallace, Ina; Berkman, Nancy; Middleton, Jennifer Cook; Barclay, Collen; Jonas, Daniel E.] Univ N Carolina, RTI Int, Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Feltner, Cynthia; Jonas, Daniel E.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Med, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Feltner, Cynthia; Kistler, Christine E.; Middleton, Jennifer Cook; Barclay, Collen; Jonas, Daniel E.] Univ N Carolina, Cecil G Sheps Ctr Hlth Serv Res, 725 Martin Luther King Jr Blvd,CB 7295, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Wallace, Ina; Berkman, Nancy; Green, Joshua T.] RTI Int, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Kistler, Christine E.; Higginbotham, Laura] Univ N Carolina, Dept Family Med, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA",,"Feltner, C (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Cecil G Sheps Ctr Hlth Serv Res, 725 Martin Luther King Jr Blvd,CB 7295, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",cindy_feltner@med.unc.edu,,"Wallace, Ina/0000-0002-0194-4041; Berkman, Nancy/0000-0003-3617-1082","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA-290-2012-00015-I, 5]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA-290-2012-00015-I, Task Order 5, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the USPSTF.",,49,55,55,1,12,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

It can impair walking and, in severe cases, can lead to tissue loss, infection, and amputation. In addition to morbidity directly caused by PAD, patients with PAD are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, because atherosclerosis is a systemic disease that also causes coronary and cerebrovascular events. OBJECTIVE To update the 2013 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for PAD and CVD risk with the ankle-brachial index (ABI). EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on whether screening for PAD with the ABI in generally asymptomatic adults reduces morbidity or mortality from PAD or CVD. The current review expanded on the previous review to include individuals with diabetes and interventions that include supervised exercise and physical therapy intended to improve outcomes in the lower limbs. FINDINGS The USPSTF found few data on the accuracy of the ABI for identifying asymptomatic persons who can benefit from treatment of PAD or CVD. There are few studies addressing the benefits of treating screen-detected patients with PAD; 2 good-quality studies showed no benefit of using the ABI to manage daily aspirin therapy in unselected populations, and 2 studies showed no benefit from exercise therapy. No studies addressed the harms of screening, although the potential exists for overdiagnosis, labeling, and opportunity costs. Studies that addressed the harms of treatment showed nonsignificant results. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening for PAD with the ABI in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for PAD and CVD risk with the ABI in asymptomatic adults.

Importance Asthma is a major public health problem worldwide and is associated with excess morbidity, mortality, and economic costs associated with lost productivity. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program has released the 2020 Asthma Guideline Update with updated evidence-based recommendations for treatment of patients with asthma. Objective To report updated recommendations for 6 topics for clinical management of adolescents and adults with asthma: (1) intermittent inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs); (2) add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists; (3) fractional exhaled nitric oxide; (4) indoor allergen mitigation; (5) immunotherapy; and (6) bronchial thermoplasty. Evidence Review The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council chose 6 topics to update the 2007 asthma guidelines based on results from a 2014 needs assessment. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality conducted systematic reviews of these 6 topics based on literature searches up to March-April 2017. Reviews were updated through October 2018 and used by an expert panel (n = 19) that included asthma content experts, primary care clinicians, dissemination and implementation experts, and health policy experts to develop 19 new recommendations using the GRADE method. The 17 recommendations for individuals aged 12 years or older are reported in this Special Communication. Findings From 20 572 identified references, 475 were included in the 6 systematic reviews to form the evidence basis for these recommendations. Compared with the 2007 guideline, there was no recommended change in step 1 (intermittent asthma) therapy (as-needed short-acting beta(2)-agonists [SABAs] for rescue therapy). In step 2 (mild persistent asthma), either daily low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA therapy or as-needed concomitant ICS and SABA therapy are recommended. Formoterol in combination with an ICS in a single inhaler (single maintenance and reliever therapy) is recommended as the preferred therapy for moderate persistent asthma in step 3 (low-dose ICS-formoterol therapy) and step 4 (medium-dose ICS-formoterol therapy) for both daily and as-needed therapy. A short-term increase in the ICS dose alone for worsening of asthma symptoms is not recommended. Add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists are recommended in individuals whose asthma is not controlled by ICS-formoterol therapy for step 5 (moderate-severe persistent asthma). Fractional exhaled nitric oxide testing is recommended to assist in diagnosis and monitoring of symptoms, but not alone to diagnose or monitor asthma. Allergen mitigation is recommended only in individuals with exposure and relevant sensitivity or symptoms. When used, allergen mitigation should be allergen specific and include multiple allergen-specific mitigation strategies. Subcutaneous immunotherapy is recommended as an adjunct to standard pharmacotherapy for individuals with symptoms and sensitization to specific allergens. Sublingual immunotherapy is not recommended specifically for asthma. Bronchial thermoplasty is not recommended as part of standard care; if used, it should be part of an ongoing research effort. Conclusions and Relevance Asthma is a common disease with substantial human and economic costs globally. Although there is no cure or established means of prevention, effective treatment is available.

We did a systematic literature search to identify the factors that explain the reasons for the ongoing epidemic in this population, using a social-ecological perspective. Common features of the HIV epidemic in American MSM include role versatility and biological, individual, and social and structural factors. The high-prevalence networks of some racial and ethnic minority men are further concentrated because of assortative mixing, adverse life experiences (including high rates of incarceration), and avoidant behaviour because of negative interactions with the health-care system. Young MSM have additional risks for HIV because their impulse control is less developed and they are less familiar with serostatus and other risk mitigation discussions. They might benefit from prevention efforts that use digital technologies, which they often use to meet partners and obtain health-related information. Older MSM remain at risk of HIV and are the largest population of US residents with chronic HIV, requiring culturally responsive programmes that address longer-term comorbidities. Transgender MSM are an understudied population, but emerging data suggest that some are at great risk of HIV and require specifically tailored information on HIV prevention. In the current era of pre-exposure prophylaxis and the undetectable equals untransmittable campaign, training of health-care providers to create culturally competent programmes for all MSM is crucial, since the use of antiretrovirals is foundational to optimising HIV care and prevention. Effective control of the HIV epidemic among all American MSM will require scaling up programmes that address their common vulnerabilities, but are sufficiently nuanced to address the specific sociocultural, structural, and behavioural issues of diverse subgroups.","[Mayer, Kenneth H.] Harvard Med Sch, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Reisner, Sari] Boston Childrens Hosp, Boston, MA USA; Fenway Hlth, Boston, MA USA; [Nelson, LaRon] Yale Univ, Sch Nursing, New Haven, CT 06536 USA; [Hightow-Weidman, Lisa] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Mimiaga, Matthew J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Mimiaga, Matthew J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Mena, Leandro] Univ Mississippi, Med Ctr, Jackson, MS 39216 USA; [Daskalakis, Demetre] New York City Dept Hlth, New York, NY USA; [Safren, Steven A.] Univ Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Beyrer, Chris] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Sullivan, Patrick S.] Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",,"Mayer, KH (corresponding author), Fenway Hlth, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",kmayer@fenwayhealth.org,,,Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR); National Institute on Drug Abuse; Harvard Center for AIDS Research [NIAID P30AI060354],Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR); National Institute on Drug Abuse(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission); Harvard Center for AIDS Research,"This Series paper was supported by unrestricted grants from The Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR), the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the Harvard Center for AIDS Research (NIAID P30AI060354).

The binding of autoantibodies to Dsg proteins induces a separation of neighbouring keratinocytes, in a process known as acantholysis. The two main pemphigus variants are pemphigus vulgaris, which often originates with painful oral erosions, and pemphigus foliaceus, which is characterised by exclusive skin lesions. Pemphigus is diagnosed on the basis of either IgG or complement component 3 deposits (or both) at the keratinocyte cell membrane, detected by direct immunofluorescence microscopy of a perilesional biopsy, with serum anti-Dsg1 or anti-Dsg3 antibodies (or both) detected by ELISA. Corticosteroids are the therapeutic mainstay, which have recently been complemented by the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab in moderate and severe disease. Rituximab induces complete remission off therapy in 90% of patients, despite rapid tapering of corticosteroids, thus allowing for a major corticosteroid-sparing effect and a halved number of adverse events related to corticosteroids.","[Schmidt, Enno] Univ Lubeck, Dept Dermatol, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany; [Schmidt, Enno] Univ Lubeck, Inst Expt Dermatol, Lubeck, Germany; [Kasperkiewicz, Michael] Univ Southern Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Joly, Pascal] Rouen Univ Hosp, Dept Dermatol, Rouen, France; [Joly, Pascal] Normandy Univ, French Reference Ctr Autoimmune Bullous Dis, INSERM Unit 2345, Rouen, France",,"Schmidt, E (corresponding author), Univ Lubeck, Dept Dermatol, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany.",enno.schmidt@uksh.de,,,German Research Foundation under Germany's Excellence Strategy [EXC 2167],German Research Foundation under Germany's Excellence Strategy,"This Seminar is dedicated to Marcel F Jonkman, Groningen, Netherlands, who contributed enormously to the field of research on pemphigus and who passed away at the height of his career after a short and severe illness.

However, in physical activity research, this life stage is poorly understood, with the evidence dominated by research in younger adolescents (aged 10-14 years), school settings, and high-income countries. Globally, 80% of adolescents are insufficiently active, and many adolescents engage in 2 h or more daily recreational screen time. In this Series paper, we present the most up-to-date global evidence on adolescent physical activity and discuss directions for identifying potential solutions to enhance physical activity in the adolescent population. Adolescent physical inactivity probably contributes to key global health problems, including cardiometabolic and mental health disorders, but the evidence is methodologically weak. Evidence-based solutions focus on three key components of the adolescent physical activity system: supportive schools, the social and digital environment, and multipurpose urban environments. Despite an increasing volume of research focused on adolescents, there are still important knowledge gaps, and efforts to improve adolescent physical activity surveillance, research, intervention implementation, and policy development are urgently needed.","[van Sluijs, Esther M.

Importance Increasing rates of preventable sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the US pose substantial burdens to health and well-being. Objective To update evidence for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) on effectiveness of behavioral counseling interventions for preventing STIs. Data Sources Studies from the previous USPSTF review (2014); literature published January 2013 through May 31, 2019, in MEDLINE, PubMed (for publisher-supplied records only), PsycINFO, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Ongoing surveillance through May 22, 2020. Study Selection Good- and fair-quality randomized and nonrandomized controlled intervention studies of behavioral counseling interventions for adolescents and adults conducted in primary care settings were included. Studies with active comparators only or limited to individuals requiring specialist care for STI risk-related comorbidities were excluded. Data Extraction and Synthesis Dual risk of bias assessment, with inconsistent ratings adjudicated by a third team member. Study data were abstracted into prespecified forms. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using the DerSimonian and Laird method or the restricted maximum likelihood method with Knapp-Hartung adjustment. Main Outcomes and Measures Differences in STI diagnoses, self-reported condom use, and self-reported unprotected sex at 3 months or more after baseline. Results The review included 37 randomized trials and 2 nonrandomized controlled intervention studies (N = 65888; 13 good-quality, 26 fair-quality) recruited from primary care settings in the US. Study populations were composed predominantly of heterosexual adolescents and young adults (12 to 25 years), females, and racial and ethnic minorities at increased risk for STIs. Nineteen trials (n = 52072) reported STI diagnoses as outcomes (3 to 17 months' follow-up); intervention was associated with reduced STI incidence (OR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.54-0.81; I-2 = 74%]). Absolute differences in STI acquisition between groups varied widely depending on baseline population STI risk and intervention effectiveness, ranging from 19% fewer to 4% more people acquiring STI. Thirty-four trials (n = 21417) reported behavioral change outcomes. Interventions were associated with self-reported behavioral change (eg, increased condom use) that reduce STI risk (OR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.10-1.56; I-2 = 40%, n = 5253). There was limited evidence on persistence of intervention effects beyond 1 year. No harms were identified in 7 studies (n = 3458) reporting adverse outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance Behavioral counseling interventions for individuals seeking primary health care were associated with reduced incidence of STIs. Group or individual counseling sessions lasting more than 2 hours were associated with larger reductions in STI incidence, and interventions of shorter duration also were associated with STI prevention, although evidence was limited on whether the STI reductions associated with these interventions persisted beyond 1 year.","[Henderson, Jillian T.; Senger, Caitlyn A.; Henninger, Michelle; Bean, Sarah I.; Redmond, Nadia; O'Connor, Elizabeth A.] Kaiser Permanente, Ctr Hlth Res, Kaiser Permanente Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Northwest 3800 N Interstate Ave, Portland, OR 97227 USA",,"Henderson, JT (corresponding author), Kaiser Permanente, Ctr Hlth Res, Kaiser Permanente Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Northwest 3800 N Interstate Ave, Portland, OR 97227 USA.",Jillian.T.Henderson@kpchr.org,"Palma, Melissa/AAI-6103-2021","Palma, Melissa/0000-0003-1349-7928","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA2902015000017I, 5]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA2902015000017I, Task Order No. 5, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services.",,102,11,12,0,11,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Rotaviruses primarily affect young children, accounting for almost 40% of hospital admissions for diarrhoea and 200 000 deaths worldwide, with the majority of deaths occurring in developing countries. Two vaccines against rotavirus were licensed in 2006 and have been implemented in 95 countries as of April, 2018. Data from eight high-income and middle-income countries showed a 49-89% decline in rotavirus-associated hospital admissions and a 17-55% decline in all-cause gastroenteritis-associated hospital admissions among children younger than 5 years, within 2 years of vaccine introduction. Noroviruses affect people of all ages, and are a leading cause of foodborne disease and outbreaks of gastroenteritis worldwide. Prevention of norovirus infection relies on frequent hand hygiene, limiting contact with people who are infected with the virus, and disinfection of contaminated environmental surfaces. Norovirus vaccine candidates are in clinical trials; whether vaccines will provide durable protection against the range of genetically and antigenically diverse norovirus strains remains unknown. Treatment of viral gastroenteritis is based primarily on replacement of fluid and electrolytes.","[Banyai, Krisztian] Hungarian Acad Sci, Vet Med Res Inst, Agr Res Ctr, H-1581 Budapest, Hungary; [Estes, Mary K.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Mol Virol & Microbiol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Martella, Vito] Univ Aldo Moro Bari, Dept Vet Med, Prov Rd Casamassima, Valenzano, Italy; [Parashar, Umesh D.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Viral Gastroenteritis Branch, Div Viral Dis, Atlanta, GA USA",,"Banyai, K (corresponding author), Hungarian Acad Sci, Vet Med Res Inst, Agr Res Ctr, H-1581 Budapest, Hungary.",bkrota@hotmail.com,"Martella, Vito/K-3146-2016","Martella, Vito/0000-0002-5740-6947; Banyai, Krisztian/0000-0002-6270-1772","Momentum Program - Hungarian Academy of Sciences; National Institutes of Health [AI080656, AI105101, AI057788]; University of Bari (2017-University of Bari-PRIN 2015); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES [R01AI080656, R01AI105101, U19AI116497, P01AI057788] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",Momentum Program - Hungarian Academy of Sciences; National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); University of Bari (2017-University of Bari-PRIN 2015); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)),"KB is supported by the Momentum Program awarded by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

Anaemia is one of many consequences of iron deficiency, and clinical and functional impairments can occur in the absence of anaemia. Iron deprivation from erythroblasts and other tissues occurs when total body stores of iron are low or when inflammation causes withholding of iron from the plasma, particularly through the action of hepcidin, the main regulator of systemic iron homoeostasis. Oral iron therapy is the first line of treatment in most cases. Hepcidin upregulation by oral iron supplementation limits the absorption efficiency of high-dose oral iron supplementation, and of oral iron during inflammation. Modern parenteral iron formulations have substantially altered iron treatment and enable rapid, safe total-dose iron replacement. An underlying cause should be sought in all patients presenting with iron deficiency: screening for coeliac disease should be considered routinely, and endoscopic investigation to exclude bleeding gastrointestinal lesions is warranted in men and postmenopausal women presenting with iron deficiency anaemia. Iron supplementation programmes in low-income countries comprise part of the solution to meeting WHO Global Nutrition Targets.","[Pasricha, Sant-Rayn] Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Populat Hlth & Immun Div, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Tye-Din, Jason] Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Div Immunol, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Pasricha, Sant-Rayn] Royal Melbourne Hosp, Dept Diagnost Haematol, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Tye-Din, Jason] Royal Melbourne Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Pasricha, Sant-Rayn] Peter MacCallum Canc Ctr, Dept Clin Haematol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Pasricha, Sant-Rayn] Royal Melbourne Hosp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Pasricha, Sant-Rayn; Tye-Din, Jason] Univ Melbourne, Dept Med Biol, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Muckenthaler, Martina U.] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Pediat Oncol Hematol & Immunol, Heidelberg, Germany; [Muckenthaler, Martina U.] Heidelberg Univ, Mol Med Partnership Unit, Heidelberg, Germany; [Muckenthaler, Martina U.] European Mol Biol Lab, Mol Med Partnership Unit, Heidelberg, Germany; [Muckenthaler, Martina U.] German Ctr Lung Res, Translat Lung Res Ctr, Heidelberg, Germany; [Muckenthaler, Martina U.] German Ctr Cardiovasc Res, Partner Site Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany; [Swinkels, Dorine W.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr, Dept Lab Med, Translat Metab Lab, Nijmegen, Netherlands",,"Pasricha, SR (corresponding author), Walter & Eliza Hall Inst Med Res, Populat Hlth & Immun Div, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.",pasricha.s@wehi.edu.au,"Pasricha, Sant-Rayn/H-8436-2019","Pasricha, Sant-Rayn/0000-0002-5502-0434; Muckenthaler, Martina/0000-0002-3778-510X","National Health and Medical Research Council [GNT1176553]; Mathison Centenary Fellowship, University of Melbourne; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB1036, SFB1118]; Federal Ministry of Education and Research (NephrESA) [031L0191C]; Dietmar Hopp-Stiftung; Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst","National Health and Medical Research Council(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Mathison Centenary Fellowship, University of Melbourne; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Federal Ministry of Education and Research (NephrESA); Dietmar Hopp-Stiftung; Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD))","S-RP is supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council (GNT1158696) for this work, and holds grants from the National Health and Medical Research Council (GNT1159171, GNT1159151, GNT1141185, and GNT1103262) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation outside the current work.

OBJECTIVE To systematically review literature on the effectiveness and harms of fall prevention interventions in community-dwelling older adults to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, PubMed, Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant English-language literature published through August 2016, with ongoing surveillance through February 7, 2018. STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials of interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years and older. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Independent critical appraisal and data abstraction by 2 reviewers. Random-effects meta-analyses using the method of DerSimonian and Laird. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Number of falls (number of unexpected events in which a person comes to rest on the ground, floor, or lower level), people experiencing 1 or more falls, injurious falls, people experiencing injurious falls, fractures, people experiencing fractures, mortality, hospitalizations, institutionalizations, changes in disability, and treatment harms. RESULTS Sixty-two randomized clinical trials (N = 35 058) examining 7 fall prevention intervention types were identified. This article focused on the 3 most commonly studied intervention types: multifactorial (customized interventions based on initial comprehensive individualized falls risk assessment) (26 trials [n = 15 506]), exercise (21 trials [n = 7297]), and vitamin D supplementation (7 trials [n = 7531]). Multifactorial intervention trials were associated with a reduction in falls (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.79 [95% Cl, 0.68-0.91]) but were not associated with a reduction in other fall-related morbidity and mortality outcomes. Exercise trials were associated with statistically significant reductions in people experiencing a fall (relative risk, 0.89 [95% 13 Cl, 0.81-0.97]) and injurious falls (IRR, 0.81 [95% Cl, 0.73-0.90]) and with a statistically nonsignificant reduction in falls (IRR, 0.87 [95% Cl, 0.75-1.00]) but showed no association with mortality. Few exercise trials reported fall-related fractures. Seven heterogeneous trials of vitamin D formulations (with or without calcium) showed mixed results. One trial of annual high-dose cholecalciferol (500 000 IU), which has not been replicated, showed an increase in falls, people experiencing a fall, and injuries, while 1 trial of calcitriol showed a reduction in falls and people experiencing a fall; the remaining 5 trials showed no significant difference in falls, people experiencing a fall, or injuries. Harms of multifactorial and exercise trials were rarely reported but generally included minor musculoskeletal injuries. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Multifactorial and exercise interventions were associated with fall-related benefit, but evidence was most consistent across multiple fall-related outcomes for exercise. Vitamin D supplementation interventions had mixed results, with a high dose being associated with higher rates of fall-related outcomes.","[Guirguis-Blake, Janelle M.; Perdue, Leslie A.; Coppola, Erin L.; Beil, Tracy L.] Kaiser Permanente, Res Affiliates Evidence based Practice Ctr Ctr Hl, Portland, OR USA; [Guirguis-Blake, Janelle M.] Univ Washington, Dept Family Med, Tacoma, WA USA; [Michael, Yvonne L.] Drexel Univ, Dornsife Sch Publ Hlth, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,"Guirguis-Blake, JM (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Family Med, Kaiser Permanente Res Affiliates EPC, 521 Martin Luther King Jr Way, Tacoma, WA 98405 USA.",jguirgui@u.washington.edu,"Michael, Yvonne Louise/AAB-9995-2020",,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA-290-2012-00015-I-EPC4]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA-290-2012-00015-I-EPC4, Task Order 6, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the USPSTF.",,78,161,169,18,94,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Previous studies have tracked past and projected future health spending until 2040 and shown that, with economic development, countries tend to spend more on health per capita, with a decreasing share of spending from development assistance and out-of-pocket sources. We aimed to characterise the past, present, and predicted future of global health spending, with an emphasis on equity in spending across countries. Methods We estimated domestic health spending for 195 countries and territories from 1995 to 2016, split into three categories-government, out-of-pocket, and prepaid private health spending-and estimated development assistance for health (DAH) from 1990 to 2018. We estimated future scenarios of health spending using an ensemble of linear mixed-effects models with time series specifications to project domestic health spending from 2017 through 2050 and DAH from 2019 through 2050. Data were extracted from a broad set of sources tracking health spending and revenue, and were standardised and converted to inflation-adjusted 2018 US dollars. Incomplete or low-quality data were modelled and uncertainty was estimated, leading to a complete data series of total, government, prepaid private, and out-of-pocket health spending, and DAH. Estimates are reported in 2018 US dollars, 2018 purchasing-power parity-adjusted dollars, and as a percentage of gross domestic product. We used demographic decomposition methods to assess a set of factors associated with changes in government health spending between 1995 and 2016 and to examine evidence to support the theory of the health financing transition. We projected two alternative future scenarios based on higher government health spending to assess the potential ability of governments to generate more resources for health. Findings Between 1995 and 2016, health spending grew at a rate of 4.00% (95% uncertainty interval 3.89-4.12) annually, although it grew slower in per capita terms (2.72% [2.61-2.84]) and increased by less than $ 1 per capita over this period in 22 of 195 countries. The highest annual growth rates in per capita health spending were observed in upper-middle-income countries (5.55% [5.18-5.95]), mainly due to growth in government health spending, and in lower-middle-income countries (3.71% [3.10-4.34]), mainly from DAH. Health spending globally reached $ 8.0 trillion (7.8-8.1) in 2016 (comprising 8.6% [8.4-8.7] of the global economy and $ 10.3 trillion [10.1-10.6] in purchasing-power parity-adjusted dollars), with a per capita spending of US$ 5252 (5184-5319) in high-income countries, $ 491 (461-524) in upper-middle-income countries, $ 81 (74-89) in lower-middle-income countries, and $ 40 (38-43) in low-income countries. In 2016, 0.4% (0.3-0.4) of health spending globally was in low-income countries, despite these countries comprising 10.0% of the global population. In 2018, the largest proportion of DAH targeted HIV/AIDS ($ 9.5 billion, 24.3% of total DAH), although spending on other infectious diseases (excluding tuberculosis and malaria) grew fastest from 2010 to 2018 (6.27% per year). The leading sources of DAH were the USA and private philanthropy (excluding corporate donations and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation). For the first time, we included estimates of China's contribution to DAH ($ 644.7 million in 2018). Globally, health spending is projected to increase to $ 15.0 trillion (14.0-16.0) by 2050 (reaching 9.4% [7.6-11.3] of the global economy and $ 21.3 trillion [19.8-23.1] in purchasing-power parity-adjusted dollars), but at a lower growth rate of 1.84% (1.68-2.02) annually, and with continuing disparities in spending between countries. In 2050, we estimate that 0.6% (0.6-0.7) of health spending will occur in currently low-income countries, despite these countries comprising an estimated 15.7% of the global population by 2050. The ratio between per capita health spending in high-income and low-income countries was 130.2 (122.9-136.9) in 2016 and is projected to remain at similar levels in 2050 (125.9 [113.7-138.1]). The decomposition analysis identified governments' increased prioritisation of the health sector and economic development as the strongest factors associated with increases in government health spending globally. Future government health spending scenarios suggest that, with greater prioritisation of the health sector and increased government spending, health spending per capita could more than double, with greater impacts in countries that currently have the lowest levels of government health spending. Interpretation Financing for global health has increased steadily over the past two decades and is projected to continue increasing in the future, although at a slower pace of growth and with persistent disparities in per-capita health spending between countries. Out-of-pocket spending is projected to remain substantial outside of high-income countries. Many low-income countries are expected to remain dependent on development assistance, although with greater government spending, larger investments in health are feasible. In the absence of sustained new investments in health, increasing efficiency in health spending is essential to meet global health targets.","[Chang, Angela Y.; Cowling, Krycia; Micah, Angela E.; Chapin, Abigail; Chen, Catherine S.; Ikilezi, Gloria; Sadat, Nafis; Tsakalos, Golsum; Wu, Junjie; Younker, Theodore; Zhao, Yingxi; Zlavog, Bianca S.; Deipatine, Selina; Fullman, Nancy; Haakenstad, Annie; Hay, Simon, I; James, Spencer L.; Khan, Junaid; Mokdad, Ali H.; Srinivasan, Vinay; Torre, Anna; Chew, Adrienne; Murray, Christopher J.

Four species of ebolaviruses have been identified in west or equatorial Africa. Once the more virulent forms enter the human population, transmission occurs primarily through contact with infected body fluids and can result in major epidemics in under-resourced settings. These viruses cause a disease characterised by systemic viral replication, immune suppression, abnormal inflammatory responses, major fluid and electrolyte losses, and high mortality. Despite recent progress on vaccines, and with no licensed prophylaxis or treatment available, case management is essentially supportive with management of severe multiple organ failure resulting from immune-mediated cell damage. The 2013-16 outbreak was classified by WHO as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, which drew attention to the challenges of diseases caused by infections with ebolaviruses and questioned scientific, clinical, and societal preparation to handle future epidemics.","[Malvy, Denis] Univ Hosp Ctr Bordeaux, Dept Infect & Trop Dis, F-33075 Bordeaux, France; [Malvy, Denis] Univ Bordeaux, INSERM 1219, Bordeaux, France; [McElroy, Anita K.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [de Clerck, Hilde] Med Sans Frontieres, Brussels, Belgium; [Guenther, Stephan] Bernhard Nocht Inst Trop Med, Dept Virol, Hamburg, Germany; [van Griensven, Johan] Inst Trop Med, Antwerp, Belgium",,"Malvy, D (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Ctr Bordeaux, Dept Infect & Trop Dis, F-33075 Bordeaux, France.",denis.malvy@chu-bordeaux.fr,,"McElroy, Anita/0000-0001-6764-7536; Gunther, Stephan/0000-0002-6562-0230",,,,,130,152,159,6,110,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,MAR 2,2019,393,10174,,,,,936,948,,10.1016/S0140-6736(18)33132-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)33132-5,,,13,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,HN4AP,30777297,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000460126900032,View Full Record in Web of Science,38133,0,61,26,101,98,57,64,82,57,69,108,78,8,75,9,67

Many patients with glaucoma are asymptomatic early in the disease course. Primary care clinicians should know which patients to refer to an eye care professional for a complete eye examination to check for signs of glaucoma and to determine what systemic conditions or medications can increase a patient's risk of glaucoma. Open-angle and narrow-angle forms of glaucoma are reviewed, including a description of the pathophysiology, risk factors, screening, disease monitoring, and treatment options. OBSERVATIONS Glaucoma is a chronic progressive optic neuropathy, characterized by damage to the optic nerve and retinal nerve fiber layer, that can lead to permanent loss of peripheral or central vision. Intraocular pressure is the only known modifiable risk factor. Other important risk factors include older age, nonwhite race, and a family history of glaucoma. Several systemic medical conditions and medications including corticosteroids, anticholinergics, certain antidepressants, and topiramate may predispose patients to glaucoma. There are 2 broad categories of glaucoma, open-angle and angle-closure glaucoma. Diagnostic testing to assess for glaucoma and to monitor for disease progression includes measurement of intraocular pressure, perimetry, and optical coherence tomography. Treatment of glaucoma involves lowering intraocular pressure. This can be achieved with various classes of glaucoma medications as well as laser and incisional surgical procedures. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Vision loss from glaucoma can be minimized by recognizing systemic conditions and medications that increase a patient's risk of glaucoma and referring high-risk patients for a complete ophthalmologic examination. Clinicians should ensure that patients remain adherent with taking glaucoma medications and should monitor for adverse events from medical or surgical interventions used to treat glaucoma.","[Stein, Joshua D.; Weizer, Jennifer S.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, WK Kellogg Eye Ctr, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Stein, Joshua D.] Univ Michigan, Ctr Eye Policy & Innovat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Stein, Joshua D.] Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Management & Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Khawaja, Anthony P.] Moorfields Eye Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, NIHR Biomed Res Ctr, London, England; [Khawaja, Anthony P.] UCL Inst Ophthalmol, London, England",,"Stein, JD (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Kellogg Eye Ctr, 1000 Wall St, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA.",jdstein@med.umich.edu,,"Khawaja, Anthony/0000-0001-6802-8585",Lighthouse Guild; National Eye Institute [1R01EY026641-01A1]; Dr Beverley and Gerson Geltner Fund; Research to Prevent Blindness; Moorfields Eye Charity Career Development Fellowship; UKRI [MR/T040912/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Lighthouse Guild; National Eye Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); Dr Beverley and Gerson Geltner Fund; Research to Prevent Blindness(Research to Prevent Blindness (RPB)); Moorfields Eye Charity Career Development Fellowship; UKRI,"The Lighthouse Guild, National Eye Institute (1R01EY026641-01A1), and Dr Beverley and Gerson Geltner Fund (Dr Stein); Research to Prevent Blindness (Drs Stein and Weizer); Moorfields Eye Charity Career Development Fellowship (Dr Khawaja).",,83,45,46,34,74,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

OBJECTIVE To review literature on the effectiveness and harms of screening and counseling for unhealthy alcohol use to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through October 12, 2017; literature surveillance through August 1, 2018. STUDY SELECTION Test accuracy studies and randomized clinical trials of screening and counseling to reduce unhealthy alcohol use. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Independent critical appraisal and data abstraction by 2 reviewers. Counseling trials were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Sensitivity, specificity, drinks perweek, exceeding recommended limits, heavy use episodes, abstinence (for pregnant women), and other health, family, social, and legal outcomes. RESULTS One hundred thirteen studies (N = 314 466) were included. No studies examined benefits or harms of screening programs to reduce unhealthy alcohol use. For adolescents (10 studies [n = 171 363]), 1 study (n = 225) reported a sensitivity of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.60 to 0.83) and specificity of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.74 to 0.86) using the AUDIT-C (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption) to detect the full spectrum of unhealthy alcohol use. For adults (35 studies [n = 114 182]), brief screening instruments commonly reported sensitivity and specificity between 0.70 and 0.85. Two trials of the effects of interventions to reduce unhealthy alcohol use in adolescents (n = 588) found mixed results: one reported a benefit in high-risk but not moderate-risk drinkers, and the other reported a statistically significant reduction in drinking frequency for boys but not girls; neither reported health or related outcomes. Across all populations (68 studies [n = 36 528]), counseling interventions were associated with a decrease in drinks per week (weighted mean difference, -1.6 [95% CI, -2.2 to -1.0]; 32 studies [37 effects; n = 15 974]), the proportion exceeding recommended drinking limits (odds ratio [OR], 0.60 [95% CI, 0.53 to 0.67]; 15 studies [16 effects; n = 9760]), and the proportion reporting a heavy use episode (OR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.58 to 0.77]; 12 studies [14 effects; n = 8108]), and an increase in the proportion of pregnant women reporting abstinence (OR, 2.26 [95% CI, 1.43 to 3.56]; 5 studies [n = 796]) after 6 to 12 months. Health outcomes were sparsely reported and generally did not demonstrate group differences in effect. There was no evidence that these interventions could be harmful. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults, screening instruments feasible for use in primary care are available that can effectively identify people with unhealthy alcohol use, and counseling interventions in those who screen positive are associated with reductions in unhealthy alcohol use. There was no evidence that these interventions have unintended harmful effects.","[O'Connor, Elizabeth A.; Perdue, Leslie A.; Senger, Caitlyn A.; Rushkin, Megan; Patnode, Carrie D.; Bean, Sarah I.] Kaiser Permanente, Ctr Hlth Res, Kaiser Permanente Res Affiliates Evidence Based P, Portland, OR USA; [Jonas, Daniel E.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA",,"O'Connor, EA (corresponding author), Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Kaiser Permanente Res Affiliates Evidence Based P, Ctr Hlth Res, 3800 N Interstate Ave, Portland, OR 97227 USA.",elizabethoconnor@kpchr.org,,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA-290-2015-000017-I-EPC5]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA-290-2015-000017-I-EPC5, Task Order No. 2 from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the USPSTF.",,178,82,83,1,30,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

But the way breast cancer is viewed has changed drastically since its molecular hallmarks were extensively characterised, now including immunohistochemical markers (eg, ER, PR, HER2 [ERBB2], and proliferation marker protein Ki-67 [MKI67]), genomic markers (eg, BRCA1, BRCA2, and PIK3CA), and immunomarkers (eg, tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and PD-L1). New biomarker combinations are the basis for increasingly complex diagnostic algorithms. Neoadjuvant combination therapy, often including targeted agents, is a standard of care (especially in HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer), and the basis for de-escalation of surgery in the breast and axilla and for risk-adapted post-neoadjuvant strategies. Radiotherapy remains an important cornerstone of breast cancer therapy, but de-escalation schemes have become the standard of care. ER-positive tumours are treated with 5-10 years of endocrine therapy and chemotherapy, based on an individual risk assessment. For metastatic breast cancer, standard therapy options include targeted approaches such as CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, depending on tumour type and molecular profile. This range of treatment options reflects the complexity of breast cancer therapy today.","[Loibl, Sibylle; Denkert, Carsten] German Breast Grp, D-63263 Neu Isenburg, Germany; [Loibl, Sibylle] Ctr Haematol & Oncol Bethanien, Frankfurt, Germany; [Poortmans, Philip] Iridium Kankernetwerk, Dept Radiat Oncol, Antwerp, Belgium; [Poortmans, Philip] Univ Antwerp, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Antwerp, Belgium; [Morrow, Monica] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Surg, Breast Serv, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Denkert, Carsten] Philipps Univ Marburg, Inst Pathol, Marburg, Germany; [Denkert, Carsten] Univ Hosp Marburg, Marburg, Germany; [Curigliano, Giuseppe] European Inst Oncol IRCCS, Milan, Italy; [Curigliano, Giuseppe] Univ Milan, Milan, Italy",,"Loibl, S (corresponding author), German Breast Grp, D-63263 Neu Isenburg, Germany.",sibylle.loibl@gbg.de,"Curigliano, Giuseppe/D-3371-2018; Denkert, Carsten/AHE-2675-2022","Curigliano, Giuseppe/0000-0003-1781-2518; ",,,,,223,124,127,211,307,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,MAY 8,2021,397,10286,,,,,1750,1769,,10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32381-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32381-3,,MAY 2021,20,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,RY3KF,33812473,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000647813600030,View Full Record in Web of Science,38314,0,158,63,31,183,33,16,27,86,14,33,111,51,95,53,134

The condition affects between 5% and 10% of otherwise healthy individuals at any one point in time and, in most people, runs a relapsing and remitting course. The best described risk factor is acute enteric infection, but irritable bowel syndrome is also more common in people with psychological comorbidity and in young adult women than in the rest of the general population. The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome is incompletely understood, but it is well established that there is disordered communication between the gut and the brain, leading to motility disturbances, visceral hypersensitivity, and altered CNS processing. Other less reproducible mechanisms might include genetic associations, alterations in gastrointestinal microbiota, and disturbances in mucosal and immune function. In most people, diagnosis can be made on the basis of clinical history with limited and judicious use of investigations, unless alarm symptoms such as weight loss or rectal bleeding are present, or there is a family history of inflammatory bowel disease or coeliac disease. Once the diagnosis is made, an empathetic approach is key and can improve quality of life and symptoms, and reduce health-care expenditure. The mainstays of treatment include patient education about the condition, dietary changes, soluble fibre, and antispasmodic drugs. Other treatments tend to be reserved for people with severe symptoms and include central neuromodulators, intestinal secretagogues, drugs acting on opioid or 5-HT receptors, or minimally absorbed antibiotics (all of which are selected according to predominant bowel habit), as well as psychological therapies. Increased understanding of the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome in the past 10 years has led to a healthy pipeline of novel drugs in development.","[Ford, Alexander C.] Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Med Res St Jamess, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Ford, Alexander C.] St James Univ Hosp, Leeds Gastroenterol Inst, Leeds LS9 7TF, W Yorkshire, England; [Sperber, Ami D.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Fac Hlth Sci, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Corsetti, Maura] Nottingham Univ Hosp NHS Trust, Nottingham Biomed Res Ctr, Natl Inst Hlth Res, Nottingham, England; [Corsetti, Maura] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Digest Dis Ctr, Sch Med, Nottingham, England; [Camilleri, Michael] Mayo Clin, Clin Enter Neurosci Translat & Epidemiol Res, Rochester, MN USA",,"Ford, AC (corresponding author), St James Univ Hosp, Leeds Gastroenterol Inst, Leeds LS9 7TF, W Yorkshire, England.",alexf12399@yahoo.com,"Ford, Alexander C/K-5491-2012","Ford, Alexander C/0000-0001-6371-4359; Corsetti, Maura/0000-0003-2957-4684",,,,,149,100,109,28,48,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,NOV 21,2020,396,10263,,,,,1675,1688,,10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31548-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31548-8,,,14,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,OU3IH,33049223,Green Accepted,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000591424900031,View Full Record in Web of Science,38410,0,18,117,111,53,46,70,61,71,77,142,109,93,6,137,74

Screening for PAD with the ankle-brachial index (ABI) may identify patients in need of treatment to improve health outcomes. OBJECTIVE To systematically review evidence for the US Preventive Services Task Force on PAD screening with the ABI, the diagnostic accuracy of the test, and the benefits and harms of treatment of screen-detected PAD. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant English-language studies published between January 2012 and May 2, 2017. Surveillance continued through February 7, 2018. STUDY SELECTION Studies of unselected or generally asymptomatic adults with no known cardiovascular disease. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Independent critical appraisal and data abstraction by 2 reviewers. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cardiovascular morbidity; PAD morbidity; mortality; health-related quality of life; diagnostic accuracy; and serious adverse events. RESULTS Five studies (N = 5864 participants) were included that examined the indirect evidence for the benefits and harms of screening and treatment of screen-detected PAD. No population-based screening trials evaluated the direct benefits or harms of PAD screening with the ABI alone. A single diagnostic accuracy study of the ABI compared with magnetic resonance angiography gold-standard imaging (n = 306) found low sensitivity (7%-34%) and high specificity (96%-100%) in a screening population. Two adequately powered trials (n = 4626) in asymptomatic populations with and without diabetes with a variably defined low ABI (<= 0.95 or <= 0.99) showed no statistically significant effect of aspirin (100 mg daily) for composite CVD outcomes (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.00 [95% CI, 0.81-1.23] and HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.76-1.26]). One trial (n = 3350) demonstrated no statistically significant increase in major bleeding events with the use of aspirin (adjusted HR, 1.71 [95% CI, 0.99-2.97]) and no statistically significant increase in major gastrointestinal bleeding (relative risk, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.44-2.91]). Two exercise trials (n = 932) in screen-relevant populations reported no differences in quality of life, Walking Impairment Questionnaire walking distance, or symptoms at 12 and 52 weeks; no harms were reported. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE There was no direct evidence and limited indirect evidence on the benefits of PAD screening with the ABI in unselected or asymptomatic populations. Available studies suggest low sensitivity and lack of beneficial effect on health outcomes, but these studies have important limitations.","[Guirguis-Blake, Janelle M.] Univ Washington, Dept Family Med, Tacoma, WA USA; [Guirguis-Blake, Janelle M.; Evans, Corinne V.; Redmond, Nadia; Lin, Jennifer S.] Kaiser Permanente, Ctr Hlth Res, Kaiser Permanente Res Affiliates Evidence Based P, Portland, OR USA",,"Guirguis-Blake, JM (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Family Med, Kaiser Permanente Res Affiliates Evidence Based P, 521 Martin Luther King Jr Way, Tacoma, WA 98405 USA.",jguirgui@u.washington.edu,,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA290201500007I]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA290201500007I, Task Order 2, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the USPSTF.",,67,31,33,3,8,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Osteoarthritis is the most frequent reason for activity limitation in adults. This Review focuses on hip and knee OA. Observations Osteoarthritis can involve almost any joint but typically affects the hands, knees, hips, and feet. It is characterized by pathologic changes in cartilage, bone, synovium, ligament, muscle, and periarticular fat, leading to joint dysfunction, pain, stiffness, functional limitation, and loss of valued activities, such as walking for exercise and dancing. Risk factors include age (33% of individuals older than 75 years have symptomatic and radiographic knee OA), female sex, obesity, genetics, and major joint injury. Persons with OA have more comorbidities and are more sedentary than those without OA. The reduced physical activity leads to a 20% higher age-adjusted mortality. Several physical examination findings are useful diagnostically, including bony enlargement in knee OA and pain elicited with internal hip rotation in hip OA. Radiographic indicators include marginal osteophytes and joint space narrowing. The cornerstones of OA management include exercises, weight loss if appropriate, and education-complemented by topical or oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in those without contraindications. Intra-articular steroid injections provide short-term pain relief and duloxetine has demonstrated efficacy. Opiates should be avoided. Clinical trials have shown promising results for compounds that arrest structural progression (eg, cathepsin K inhibitors, Wnt inhibitors, anabolic growth factors) or reduce OA pain (eg, nerve growth factor inhibitors). Persons with advanced symptoms and structural damage are candidates for total joint replacement. Racial and ethnic disparities persist in the use and outcomes of joint replacement. Conclusions and Relevance Hip and knee OA are highly prevalent and disabling. Education, exercise and weight loss are cornerstones of management, complemented by NSAIDs (for patients who are candidates), corticosteroid injections, and several adjunctive medications. For persons with advanced symptoms and structural damage, total joint replacement effectively relieves pain. This narrative review summarizes the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip and knee, including use of structured exercise, acetaminophen and NSAIDs, corticosteroid injections, and surgery to manage symptoms.","[Katz, Jeffrey N.; Arant, Kaetlyn R.] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Orthoped Surg, Orthoped & Arthrit Ctr Outcomes Res, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Katz, Jeffrey N.] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Rheumatol Inflammat & Immun, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Katz, Jeffrey N.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth Boston, Dept Epidemiol, Boston, MA USA; [Loeser, Richard F.] Univ N Carolina, Div Rheumatol Allergy & Immunol, Chapel Hill, NC USA",,"Katz, JN (corresponding author), Brigham & Womens Hosp, Orthoped & Arthrit Ctr Outcomes Res, 75 Francis St,Hale 5016, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",jnkatz@bwh.harvard.edu,,,,,,,99,108,116,100,169,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

An estimated 23 million miscarriages occur every year worldwide, translating to 44 pregnancy losses each minute. The pooled risk of miscarriage is 15.3% (95% CI 12.5-18.7%) of all recognised pregnancies. The population prevalence of women who have had one miscarriage is 10.8% (10.3-11.4%), two miscarriages is 1.9% (1.8-2.1%), and three or more miscarriages is 0.7% (0.5-0.8%). Risk factors for miscarriage include very young or older female age (younger than 20 years and older than 35 years), older male age (older than 40 years), very low or very high body-mass index, Black ethnicity, previous miscarriages, smoking, alcohol, stress, working night shifts, air pollution, and exposure to pesticides. The consequences of miscarriage are both physical, such as bleeding or infection, and psychological. Psychological consequences include increases in the risk of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicide. Miscarriage, and especially recurrent miscarriage, is also a sentinel risk marker for obstetric complications, including preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, placental abruption, and stillbirth in future pregnancies, and a predictor of longer-term health problems, such as cardiovascular disease and venous thromboembolism. The costs of miscarriage affect individuals, health-care systems, and society. The short-term national economic cost of miscarriage is estimated to be 471 pound million per year in the UK. As recurrent miscarriage is a sentinel marker for various obstetric risks in future pregnancies, women should receive care in preconception and obstetric clinics specialising in patients at high risk. As psychological morbidity is common after pregnancy loss, effective screening instruments and treatment options for mental health consequences of miscarriage need to be available. We recommend that miscarriage data are gathered and reported to facilitate comparison of rates among countries, to accelerate research, and to improve patient care and policy development.","[Quenby, Siobhan; Brosens, Jan J.; Lucas, Emma S.; Odendaal, Joshua] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Div Biomed Sci, Warwick, England; [Fisher, Joanne] Univ Warwick, Warwick Clin Trials Unit, Warwick, England; [Quenby, Siobhan; Brosens, Jan J.; Lucas, Emma S.; Odendaal, Joshua] Univ Hosp Coventry & Warwickshire NHS Trust, Tommys Natl Ctr Miscarriage Res, Coventry CV2 2DX, W Midlands, England; [Gallos, Ioannis D.; Dhillon-Smith, Rima K.; Podesek, Marcelina; Devall, Adam J.; Coomarasamy, Arri] Univ Birmingham, Tommys Natl Ctr Miscarriage Res, Inst Metab & Syst Res, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Stephenson, Mary D.] Univ Illinois, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Program, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Brewin, Jane] Tommys Char, Laurence Pountney Hill, London, England; [Ramhorst, Rosanna] Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, Inst Quim Biol, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat IQUIBICEN, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [McCoy, Rajiv C.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Anderson, Robert; Daher, Shahd; Petrou, Stavros] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Primary Care Hlth Sci, Oxford, England; [Regan, Lesley; Al-Memar, Maya; Bourne, Tom; MacIntyre, David A.; Rai, Raj; Bennett, Phillip R.] Imperial Coll London, Tommys Natl Ctr Miscarriage Res, London, England; [Christiansen, Ole B.] Aalborg Univ Hosp, Dept Obstet & Gynaecol, Ctr Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Western Denmark, Aalborg, Denmark; [Sugiura-Ogasawara, Mayumi] Nagoya City Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan",,"Quenby, S (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Coventry & Warwickshire NHS Trust, Tommys Natl Ctr Miscarriage Res, Coventry CV2 2DX, W Midlands, England.",s.quenby@warwick.ac.uk,"Devall, Adam/AAC-9646-2022; Bourne, Tom/I-6478-2012; Petrou, Stavros/ABD-8323-2021; McCoy, Rajiv/AEW-9951-2022","Bourne, Tom/0000-0003-1421-6059; Petrou, Stavros/0000-0003-3121-6050; McCoy, Rajiv/0000-0003-0615-146X; Quenby, Siobhan/0000-0003-3221-5471; MacIntyre, David/0000-0002-4186-5567; Bennett, Phillip/0000-0002-6253-4919; Gallos, Ioannis/0000-0002-2766-358X",Tommy's Charity; Wellcome Trust Investigator Award [212233/Z/18/Z],Tommy's Charity; Wellcome Trust Investigator Award(Wellcome Trust),The Tommy's Charity funds the Tommy's National Centre for Miscarriage Research.

The GKE programme pays the medical expenses of people in medium-income and low-income countries, thus enabling them to receive a kidney transplantation they otherwise could not afford. In doing so, the programme increases the global donor pool, and so benefits people in high-income countries by improving their chances of finding a donor match. Nevertheless, the GKE has been accused of being a form of organ trafficking, exploiting the poor, and involving coercion and commodification of donors. We refute these claims, arguing that the GKE promotes global justice and reduces the potential for people in need of kidneys in low-income and medium-income countries to be exploited. Misguided objections should not be allowed to prevent the GKE from realising its potential to reduce suffering and save the lives of rich and poor patients alike.","[Minerva, Francesca] Univ Ghent, Fac Philosophy & Moral Sci, Ghent, Belgium; [Savulescu, Julian] Univ Oxford, Oxford Uehiro Ctr Pract Eth, Oxford OX1 1PT, England; [Savulescu, Julian] Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Savulescu, Julian] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Singer, Peter] Princeton Univ, Univ Ctr Human Values, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Singer, Peter] Univ Melbourne, Sch Hist & Philosoph Studies, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,"Savulescu, J (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford Uehiro Ctr Pract Eth, Oxford OX1 1PT, England.",julian.savulescu@philosophy.ox.ac.uk,,"Minerva, Francesca/0000-0001-9384-586X","Uehiro Foundation on Ethics and Education; Victorian State Government; Wellcome Trust [WT203132, WT104848]; Research Foundation-Flanders",Uehiro Foundation on Ethics and Education; Victorian State Government; Wellcome Trust(Wellcome TrustEuropean Commission); Research Foundation-Flanders(FWO),"JS acknowledges support from the Uehiro Foundation on Ethics and Education, and through his involvement with the Murdoch Children's Research Institute, he received funding from the Victorian State Government through the Operational Infrastructure Support programme.

Three single-center randomized trials reported no significantly different or improved outcomes for patients who received general anesthesia compared with procedural sedation. OBJECTIVE To detect differences in functional outcome at 3 months between patients who received general anesthesia vs procedural sedation during thrombectomy for anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke. DATA SOURCE MEDLINE search for English-language articles published from January 1, 1980, to July 31, 2019. STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials of adults with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of at least 10 and anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke assigned to receive general anesthesia or procedural sedation during thrombectomy. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Individual patient data were obtained from 3 single-center, randomized, parallel-group, open-label treatment trials with blinded end point evaluation that met inclusion criteria and were analyzed using fixed-effects meta-analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Degree of disability, measured via the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score (range 0-6; lower scores indicate less disability), analyzed with the common odds ratio (cOR) to detect the ordinal shift in the distribution of disability over the range of mRS scores. RESULTS A total of 368 patients (mean [SD] age, 71.5 [12.9] years; 163 [44.3%] women; median [interquartile range] National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 17 [14-21]) were included in the analysis, including 183 (49.7%) who received general anesthesia and 185 (50.3%) who received procedural sedation. The mean 3-month mRS score was 2.8 (95% CI, 2.5-3.1) in the general anesthesia group vs 3.2 (95% CI, 3.0-3.5) in the procedural sedation group (difference, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.03-0.83]; cOR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.09-2.29]; P = .02). Among prespecified adverse events, only hypotension (decline in systolic blood pressure of more than 20% from baseline) (80.8% vs 53.1%; OR, 4.26 [95% CI, 2.55-7.09]; P < .001) and blood pressure variability (systolic blood pressure >180 mm Hg or < 120 mm Hg) (79.7 vs 62.3%; OR, 2.42 [95% CI, 1.49-3.93]; P < .001) were significantly more common in the general anesthesia group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with acute ischemic stroke involving the anterior circulation undergoing thrombectomy, the use of protocol-based general anesthesia, compared with procedural sedation, was significantly associated with less disability at 3 months. These findings should be interpreted tentatively, given that the individual trials examined were single-center trials and disability was the primary outcome in only 1 trial.","[Schoenenberger, Silvia; Ringleb, Peter A.; Wick, Wolfgang] Heidelberg Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol, Heidelberg, Germany; [Henden, Pia Loewhagen] Univ Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska Univ Hosp, Sahlgrenska Acad, Dept Anesthesiol & Intens Care Med, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Simonsen, Claus Z.] Aarhus Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol, Aarhus, Denmark; [Uhlmann, Lorenz; Klose, Christina; Kieser, Meinhard] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Med Biometry & Informat, Heidelberg, Germany; [Pfaff, Johannes A.

We aimed to determine whether perfusion imaging can identify patients with salvageable brain tissue with symptoms 4.5 h or more from stroke onset or with symptoms on waking who might benefit from thrombolysis. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data, we searched PubMed for randomised trials published in English between Jan 1, 2006, and March 1, 2019. We also reviewed the reference list of a previous systematic review of thrombolysis and searched ClinicalTrials. gov for interventional studies of ischaemic stroke. Studies of alteplase versus placebo in patients (aged =18 years) with ischaemic stroke treated more than 4.5 h after onset, or with wake-up stroke, who were imaged with perfusion-diffusion MRI or CT perfusion were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was excellent functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score 0-1) at 3 months, adjusted for baseline age and clinical severity. Safety outcomes were death and symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage. We calculated odds ratios, adjusted for baseline age and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, using mixed-effects logistic regression models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019128036. Findings We identified three trials that met eligibility criteria: EXTEND, ECASS4-EXTEND, and EPITHET. Of the 414 patients included in the three trials, 213 (51%) were assigned to receive alteplase and 201 (49%) were assigned to receive placebo. Overall, 211 patients in the alteplase group and 199 patients in the placebo group had mRS assessment data at 3 months and thus were included in the analysis of the primary outcome. 76 (36%) of 211 patients in the alteplase group and 58 (29%) of 199 patients in the placebo group had achieved excellent functional outcome at 3 months (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.86, 95% CI 1.15-2.99, p=0.011). Symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage was more common in the alteplase group than the placebo group (ten [5%] of 213 patients vs one [< 1%] of 201 patients in the placebo group; adjusted OR 9.7, 95% CI 1.23-76.55, p=0.031). 29 (14%) of 213 patients in the alteplase group and 18 (9%) of 201 patients in the placebo group died (adjusted OR 1.55, 0.81-2.96, p=0.66). Interpretation Patients with ischaemic stroke 4.5-9 h from stroke onset or wake-up stroke with salvageable brain tissue who were treated with alteplase achieved better functional outcomes than did patients given placebo. The rate of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage was higher with alteplase, but this increase did not negate the overall net benefit of thrombolysis. Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

OBJECTIVE To review empirical findings regarding the association between malpractice liability risk (ie, the extent to which clinicians face the threat of being sued and having to pay damages) and health care quality and safety. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION Systematic search of multiple databases for studies published between January 1, 1990, and November 25, 2019, examining the relationship between malpractice liability risk measures and health outcomes or structural and process indicators of health care quality. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Information on the exposure and outcome measures, results, and acknowledged limitations was extracted by 2 reviewers. Meta-analytic pooling was not possible due to variations in study designs; therefore, studies were summarized descriptively and assessed qualitatively. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Associations between malpractice risk measures and health care quality and safety outcomes. Exposure measures included physicians' malpractice insurance premiums, state tort reforms, frequency of paid claims, average claim payment, physicians' claims history, total malpractice payments, jury awards, the presence of an immunity from malpractice liability, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Medicare malpractice geographic practice cost index, and composite measures combining these measures. Outcome measures included patient mortality; hospital readmissions, avoidable admissions, and prolonged length of stay; receipt of cancer screening; Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality patient safety indicators and other measures of adverse events; measures of hospital and nursing home quality; and patient satisfaction. RESULTS Thirty-seven studies were included; 28 examined hospital care only and 16 focused on obstetrical care. Among obstetrical care studies, 9 found no significant association between liability risk and outcomes (such as Apgar score and birth injuries) and 7 found limited evidence for an association. Among 20 studies of patient mortality in nonobstetrical care settings, 15 found no evidence of an association with liability risk and 5 found limited evidence. Among 7 studies that examined hospital readmissions and avoidable initial hospitalizations, none found evidence of an association between liability risk and outcomes. Among 12 studies of other measures (eg, patient safety indicators, process-of-care quality measures, patient satisfaction), 7 found no association between liability risk and these outcomes and 5 identified significant associations in some analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this systematic review, most studies found no association between measures of malpractice liability risk and health care quality and outcomes. Although gaps in the evidence remain, the available findings suggested that greater tort liability, at least in its current form, was not associated with improved quality of care.","[Mello, Michelle M.; Blumenkranz, Erik; Studdert, David M.] Stanford Law Sch, 559 Nathan Abbott Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Mello, Michelle M.; Studdert, David M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Frakes, Michael D.] Duke Univ, Sch Law, Durham, NC 27706 USA",,"Mello, MM (corresponding author), Stanford Law Sch, 559 Nathan Abbott Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",mmello@law.stanford.edu,"Studdert, David/AAF-3116-2021","Studdert, David/0000-0003-0585-5537",National Institute on Aging; Stanford University Medical Indemnity and Trust Insurance,National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Stanford University Medical Indemnity and Trust Insurance,"Dr Frakes reported receiving grants from the National Institute on Aging during the conduct of the study.

FindingsIn this systematic review and meta-analysis of 28 randomized clinical trials of patients with primarily noncancer illness, receipt of palliative care interventions, compared with usual care, was statistically significantly associated with less acute health care use and modestly lower symptom burden, but there was no significant difference in quality of life. MeaningAmong patients with primarily noncancer illness, receipt of palliative care interventions was associated with lower acute health care use and modestly lower symptom burden, although analyses for some outcomes were based predominantly on studies of patients with heart failure, which may limit the generalizability of these findings to other chronic illnesses. ImportanceThe evidence for palliative care exists predominantly for patients with cancer. The effect of palliative care on important end-of-life outcomes in patients with noncancer illness is unclear. ObjectiveTo measure the association between palliative care and acute health care use, quality of life (QOL), and symptom burden in adults with chronic noncancer illnesses. Data SourcesMEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and PubMed from inception to April 18, 2020. Study SelectionRandomized clinical trials of palliative care interventions in adults with chronic noncancer illness. Studies involving at least 50% of patients with cancer were excluded. Data Extraction and SynthesisTwo reviewers independently screened, selected, and extracted data from studies. Narrative synthesis was conducted for all trials. All outcomes were analyzed using random-effects meta-analysis. Main Outcomes and MeasuresAcute health care use (hospitalizations and emergency department use), disease-generic and disease-specific quality of life (QOL), and symptoms, with estimates of QOL translated to units of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Palliative Care scale (range, 0 [worst] to 184 [best]; minimal clinically important difference, 9 points) and symptoms translated to units of the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale global distress score (range, 0 [best] to 90 [worst]; minimal clinically important difference, 5.7 points). ResultsTwenty-eight trials provided data on 13664 patients (mean age, 74 years; 46% were women). Ten trials were of heart failure (n=4068 patients), 11 of mixed disease (n=8119), 4 of dementia (n=1036), and 3 of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n=441). Palliative care, compared with usual care, was statistically significantly associated with less emergency department use (9 trials [n=2712]; 20% vs 24%; odds ratio, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.68-1.00]; I-2=3%), less hospitalization (14 trials [n=3706]; 38% vs 42%; odds ratio, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.65-0.99]; I-2=41%), and modestly lower symptom burden (11 trials [n = 2598]; pooled standardized mean difference (SMD), -0.12; [95% CI, -0.20 to -0.03]; I-2=0%; Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale score mean difference, -1.6 [95% CI, -2.6 to -0.4]). Palliative care was not significantly associated with disease-generic QOL (6 trials [n=1334]; SMD, 0.18 [95% CI, -0.24 to 0.61]; I-2=87%; Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Palliative Care score mean difference, 4.7 [95% CI, -6.3 to 15.9]) or disease-specific measures of QOL (11 trials [n=2204]; SMD, 0.07 [95% CI, -0.09 to 0.23]; I-2=68%). Conclusions and RelevanceIn this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of patients with primarily noncancer illness, palliative care, compared with usual care, was statistically significantly associated with less acute health care use and modestly lower symptom burden, but there was no significant difference in quality of life. Analyses for some outcomes were based predominantly on studies of patients with heart failure, which may limit generalizability to other chronic illnesses. This meta-analysis estimates the association between palliative care and health care use, disease-generic and disease-specific measures of quality of life, and symptom burden among adults with noncancer illness.","[Quinn, Kieran L.; Gitau, Kevin; Cram, Peter; Detsky, Allan S.; Bell, Chaim M.] Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Quinn, Kieran L.; Shurrab, Mohammed; Stukel, Therese A.; Cram, Peter; Bell, Chaim M.] ICES, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Quinn, Kieran L.; Shurrab, Mohammed; Stall, Nathan M.; Stukel, Therese A.; Cram, Peter; Detsky, Allan S.; Bell, Chaim M.] Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth & Evaluat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Quinn, Kieran L.; Horn, Daphne; Cram, Peter; Detsky, Allan S.; Bell, Chaim M.] Sinai Hlth Syst, Dept Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Shurrab, Mohammed] Hlth Sci North Res Inst, Sudbury, ON, Canada; [Shurrab, Mohammed] Laurentian Univ, Northern Ontario Sch Med, Sudbury, ON, Canada; [Kavalieratos, Dio] Emory Univ, Div Palliat Med, Dept Family & Prevent Med, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Isenberg, Sarina R.; Goldman, Russell] Temmy Latner Ctr Palliat Care, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Isenberg, Sarina R.; Goldman, Russell] Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Res Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Isenberg, Sarina R.; Goldman, Russell] Univ Toronto, Dept Family & Community Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Stall, Nathan M.] Womens Coll Hosp, Womens Coll Res Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Stall, Nathan M.] Univ Toronto, Div Geriatr Med, Toronto, ON, Canada",,"Quinn, KL (corresponding author), Sinai Hlth Syst, 60 Murray St,Second Floor,Room 404, Toronto, ON M5T 3L9, Canada.",kieran.quinn@mail.utoronto.ca,"Kavalieratos, Dio/GLR-1388-2022; Kavalieratos, Dio/GLV-4567-2022; Isenberg, Sarina/AAE-4407-2021","Kavalieratos, Dio/0000-0001-5283-0792; Gitau, Kevin/0000-0001-6494-8958",,,,,69,38,39,3,9,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Increased concentration of serum urate (hyperuricaemia) is the most important risk factor for the development of gout. Serum urate is regulated by urate transporters in the kidney and gut, particularly GLUT9 (SLC2A9), URAT1 (SLC22A12), and ABCG2. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by monosodium urate crystals with release of IL-1 beta plays a major role in the initiation of the gout flare; aggregated neutrophil extracellular traps are important in the resolution phase. Although presenting as an intermittent flaring condition, gout is a chronic disease. Long-term urate lowering therapy (eg, allopurinol) leads to the dissolution of monosodium urate crystals, ultimately resulting in the prevention of gout flares and tophi and in improved quality of life. Strategies such as nurse-led care are effective in delivering high-quality gout care and lead to major improvements in patient outcomes.","[Dalbeth, Nicola] Univ Auckland, Dept Med, Auckland 1023, New Zealand; [Gosling, Anna L.] Univ Otago, Dept Anat, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Gaffo, Angelo] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Med, Birmingham, AL USA; [Gaffo, Angelo] Birmingham VA Med Ctr, Birmingham, AL USA; [Abhishek, Abhishek] Univ Nottingham, Acad Rheumatol, Sch Med, Nottingham, England; [Abhishek, Abhishek] Nottingham Natl Inst Hlth Res Biomed Res Ctr, Nottingham, England",,"Dalbeth, N (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Dept Med, Auckland 1023, New Zealand.",n.dalbeth@auckland.ac.nz,"Gaffo, Angelo/ABD-1653-2021","Gaffo, Angelo/0000-0001-7365-7212",Health Research Council of New Zealand [15-105]; Royal Society of New Zealand's Rutherford Foundation [RFT-19-UOO-014]; Marsden Fund [19-UOO-132],Health Research Council of New Zealand(Health Research Council of New Zealand); Royal Society of New Zealand's Rutherford Foundation; Marsden Fund(Royal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ)),ND is supported by the Health Research Council of New Zealand (grant number 15-105).

Mutations in either the mitochondrial or nuclear genome can disrupt a plethora of cellular metabolic and homoeostatic functions. Mitochondrial diseases represent one of the most common and severe groups of inherited genetic disorders, characterised by clinical, biochemical, and genetic heterogeneity, diagnostic odysseys, and absence of disease-modifying curative therapies. This Review aims to discuss recent advances in mitochondrial biology and medicine arising from widespread use of high-throughput omics technologies, and also includes a broad discussion of emerging therapies for mitochondrial disease. New insights into both bioenergetic and biosynthetic mitochondrial functionalities have expedited the genetic diagnosis of primary mitochondrial disorders, and identified novel mitochondrial pathomechanisms and new targets for therapeutic intervention.

Data SourcesMEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Collaboration Central Registry of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL; surveillance through March 26, 2021. Study SelectionRandomized clinical trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized controlled intervention studies for effectiveness of screening; accuracy studies for screening and confirmatory measurements (ambulatory blood pressure monitoring as the reference standard); RCTs and nonrandomized controlled intervention studies and observational studies for harms of screening and confirmation. Data Extraction and SynthesisIndependent critical appraisal and data abstraction; meta-analyses and qualitative syntheses. Main Outcomes and MeasuresMortality; cardiovascular events; quality of life; sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values; harms of screening. ResultsA total of 52 studies (N=215534) were identified in this systematic review. One cluster RCT (n=140642) of a multicomponent intervention including hypertension screening reported fewer annual cardiovascular-related hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease in the intervention group compared with the control group (difference, 3.02 per 1000 people; rate ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.86-0.97]). Meta-analysis of 15 studies (n=11309) of initial office-based blood pressure screening showed a pooled sensitivity of 0.54 (95% CI, 0.37-0.70) and specificity of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.84-0.95), with considerable clinical and statistical heterogeneity. Eighteen studies (n=57128) of various confirmatory blood pressure measurement modalities were heterogeneous. Meta-analysis of 8 office-based confirmation studies (n=53183) showed a pooled sensitivity of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.68-0.88) and specificity of 0.55 (95% CI, 0.42-0.66). Meta-analysis of 4 home-based confirmation studies (n=1001) showed a pooled sensitivity of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.76-0.90) and a specificity of 0.60 (95% CI, 0.48-0.71). Thirteen studies (n=5150) suggested that screening was associated with no decrement in quality of life or psychological distress; evidence on absenteeism was mixed. Ambulatory blood pressure measurement was associated with temporary sleep disturbance and bruising. Conclusions and RelevanceScreening using office-based blood pressure measurement had major accuracy limitations, including misdiagnosis; however, direct harms of measurement were minimal. Research is needed to determine optimal screening and confirmatory algorithms for clinical practice.

Infection rates are highest among adolescents and young adults of both sexes. Chlamydial and gonococcal infections in women are usually asymptomatic and may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease and its associated complications. Newborns of pregnant persons with untreated infection may develop neonatal chlamydial pneumonia or gonococcal or chlamydial ophthalmia. Infection in men may lead to urethritis and epididymitis. Both types of infection can increase risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV. ObjectiveTo update its 2014 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons. PopulationAsymptomatic, sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons. Evidence AssessmentThe USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for chlamydia in all sexually active women 24 years or younger and in women 25 years or older who are at increased risk for infection has moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for gonorrhea in all sexually active women 24 years or younger and in women 25 years or older who are at increased risk for infection has moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men. RecommendationThe USPSTF recommends screening for chlamydia in all sexually active women 24 years or younger and in women 25 years or older who are at increased risk for infection. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends screening for gonorrhea in all sexually active women 24 years or younger and in women 25 years or older who are at increased risk for infection. (B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men.

Approximately 10% to 30% of patients with sarcoidosis develop progressive pulmonary disease. OBSERVATION Among patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, the rate of spontaneous remission without serious sequelae ranges from 10% to 82%. However, lung disease progression occurs in more than 10% of patients and can result in fibrocystic architectural distortion of the lung, which is associated with a mortality rate of 12% to 18% within 5 years. Overall, the mortality rate for sarcoidosis is approximately 7% within a 5-year follow-up period. Worldwide, more than 60% of deaths from sarcoidosis are due to pulmonary involvement; however, more than 70% of deaths from sarcoidosis are due to cardiac involvement in Japan. Up to 70% of patients with advanced pulmonary sarcoidosis develop precapillary pulmonary hypertension, which is associated with a 5-year mortality rate of approximately 40%. Patients with sarcoidosis and precapillary pulmonary hypertension should be treated with therapies such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors and prostacyclin analogues. Although optimal doses of oral glucocorticoids for pulmonary sarcoidosis are unknown, oral prednisone typically starting at a dose of 20 mg/d to 40 mg/d for 2 to 6 weeks is recommended for patients who are symptomatic (cough, dyspnea, and chest pain) and have parenchymal infiltrates and abnormal pulmonary function test results. Oral glucocorticoids can be tapered over 6 to 18 months if symptoms, pulmonary function test results, and radiographs improve. Prolonged use of oral glucocorticoids may be required to control symptoms and stabilize disease. Patients without adequate improvement while receiving a dose of prednisone of 10 mg/d or greater or those with adverse effects due to glucocorticoids may be prescribed immunosuppressive agents, such as methotrexate, azathioprine, or an anti-tumor necrosis factor medication, either alone or with glucocorticoids combined with appropriate microbial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci and herpes zoster. Effective treatments are not available for advanced fibrocystic pulmonary disease. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Sarcoidosis has a mortality rate of approximately 7% within a 5-year follow-up period. More than 10% of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis develop progressive disease and more than 60% of deaths are due to advanced pulmonary sarcoidosis. Oral glucocorticoids with or without another immunosuppressive agent are the first-line therapy for symptomatic patients with abnormal pulmonary function test results and lung infiltrates. Patients with sarcoidosis and precapillary pulmonary hypertension should be treated with therapies such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors and prostacyclin analogues.","[Belperio, John A.; Shaikh, Faisal; Weigt, S.

Canada has often aspired to be a socially progressive force abroad, using alliance building and collective action to exert influence beyond that expected from a country with moderate financial and military resources. Conversely, when Canada has primarily used economic self-interest to define its global role, the country's perceived leadership in global health has diminished. Current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal federal government has signalled a return to progressive values, driven by appreciation for diversity, equality, and Canada's responsibility to be a good global citizen. However, poor coordination of efforts, limited funding, and the unaddressed legacy of Canada's colonisation of Indigenous peoples weaken the potential for Canadians to make meaningful contributions to improvement of global health equity. Amid increased nationalism and uncertainty towards multilateral commitments by some major powers in the world, the Canadian federal government has a clear opportunity to convert its commitments to equity and global citizenship into stronger leadership on the global stage. Such leadership will require the translation of aspirational messages about health equity and inclusion into concrete action at home and internationally.","[Nixon, Stephanie A.] Univ Toronto, Dept Phys Therapy, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Nixon, Stephanie A.] Univ Toronto, Int Ctr Disabil & Rehabil, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Nixon, Stephanie A.] Univ Toronto, Rehabil Sci Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.] Univ Toronto, Dept Nutr, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Lee, Kelley] Simon Fraser Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.] Hosp Sick Children, Ctr Global Child Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Blanchard, James] Univ Manitoba, Rady Fac Hlth Sci, Ctr Global Publ Hlth, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Haddad, Slim] Univ Laval, CHU Quebec, Ctr Rech, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Haddad, Slim] Univ Laval, Dept Med Sociale & Prevent, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Hoffman, Steven J.] York Univ, Global Strategy Lab, Dahdaleh Inst Global Hlth Res, Sch Hlth Policy & Management, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Hoffman, Steven J.] York Univ, Osgoode Hall Law Sch, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Tugwell, Peter] Ottawa Hosp, Res Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Tugwell, Peter] Univ Ottawa, Dept Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Tugwell, Peter] Univ Ottawa, Sch Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Ottawa, ON, Canada",,"Nixon, SA (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Phys Therapy, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON M5G 1V7, Canada.",stephanie.nixon@utoronto.ca,"Tugwell, Peter/AFD-8076-2022; Lee, Kelley/AAE-1588-2019; Bhutta, Zulfiqar/L-7822-2015","Tugwell, Peter/0000-0001-5062-0556; Lee, Kelley/0000-0002-3625-1915; Hoffman, Steven/0000-0002-2064-3711; Blanchard, James/0000-0002-4701-590X; Bhutta, Zulfiqar/0000-0003-0637-599X",Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); International AIDS Vaccine Initiative; CIHR; US National Institutes of Health; Canada Research Chairs Programme,Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); International AIDS Vaccine Initiative; CIHR(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); US National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Canada Research Chairs Programme(Canada Research Chairs),"SAN is supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and is a paid consultant for the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative.

Findings Five decontamination processes and 42 studies were reviewed. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, moist heat, and microwave-generated steam processing were effective for pathogen removal, preserved respirator filtration, and had short treatment times and readily available equipment. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide is a suitable alternative with longer decontamination durations and is more expensive. Ethylene oxide may leave toxic residues and is less easily implemented. Meaning Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, moist heat, and microwave-generated steam processing of filtering facepiece respirators are effective means for decontamination and are simple to implement. In the context of widespread reuse and reprocessing of N95 respirators due to shortages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, this systematic review summarizes evidence on effectiveness and feasibility of 5 decontaminating processes: UV irradiation, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, moist-heat incubation, microwave-generated steam, and ethylene oxide. Importance The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a persistent shortage of personal protective equipment; therefore, a need exists for hospitals to reprocess filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), such as N95 respirators. Objective To perform a systematic review to evaluate the evidence on effectiveness and feasibility of different processes used for decontaminating N95 respirators. Evidence Review A search of PubMed and EMBASE (through January 31, 2021) was completed for 5 types of respirator-decontaminating processes including UV irradiation, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, moist-heat incubation, microwave-generated steam, and ethylene oxide. Data were abstracted on process method, pathogen removal, mask filtration efficiency, facial fit, user safety, and processing capability. Findings Forty-two studies were included that examined 65 total types of masks. All were laboratory studies (no clinical trials), and 2 evaluated respirator performance and fit with actual clinical use of N95 respirators. Twenty-seven evaluated UV germicidal irradiation, 19 vaporized hydrogen peroxide, 9 moist-heat incubation, 10 microwave-generated steam, and 7 ethylene oxide. Forty-three types of N95 respirators were treated with UV irradiation. Doses of 1 to 2 J/cm(2) effectively sterilized most pathogens on N95 respirators (>10(3) reduction in influenza virus [4 studies], MS2 bacteriophage [3 studies], Bacillus spores [2 studies], Escherichia virus MS2 [1 study], vesicular stomatitis virus [1 study], and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus/SARS-CoV-1 [1 study]) without degrading respirator components. Doses higher than 1.5 to 2 J/cm(2) may be needed based on 2 studies demonstrating greater than 10(3) reduction in SARS-CoV-2. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide eradicated the pathogen in all 7 efficacy studies (>10(4) reduction in SARS-CoV-2 [3 studies] and >10(6) reduction of Bacillus and Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores [4 studies]). Pressurized chamber systems with higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide caused FFR damage (6 studies), while open-room systems did not degrade respirator components. Moist heat effectively reduced SARS-CoV-2 (2 studies), influenza virus by greater than 10(4) (2 studies), vesicular stomatitis virus (1 study), and Escherichia coli (1 study) and preserved filtration efficiency and facial fit for 11 N95 respirators using preheated containers/chambers at 60 degrees C to 85 degrees C (5 studies); however, diminished filtration performance was seen for the Caron incubator. Microwave-generated steam (1100-W to 1800-W devices; 40 seconds to 3 minutes) effectively reduced pathogens by greater than 10(3) (influenza virus [2 studies], MS2 bacteriophage [3 studies], and Staphylococcus aureus [1 study]) and maintained filtration performance in 10 N95 respirators; however, damage was noted in least 1 respirator type in 4 studies. In 6 studies, ethylene oxide preserved respirator components in 16 N95 respirator types but left residual carcinogenic by-product (1 study). Conclusions and Relevance Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, moist heat, and microwave-generated steam processing effectively sterilized N95 respirators and retained filtration performance. Ultraviolet irradiation and vaporized hydrogen peroxide damaged respirators the least. More research is needed on decontamination effectiveness for SARS-CoV-2 because few studies specifically examined this pathogen.","[Schumm, Max A.; Hadaya, Joseph E.; Maggard-Gibbons, Melinda] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Surg, David Geffen Sch Med, 10833 Le Conte Ave,72-227 CHS, Los Angeles, CA 90025 USA; [Mody, Nisha; Myers, Bethany A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Louise M Darling Biomed Lib, UCLA Lib, Los Angeles, CA USA",,"Schumm, MA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Surg, David Geffen Sch Med, 10833 Le Conte Ave,72-227 CHS, Los Angeles, CA 90025 USA.",mschumm@mednet.ucla.edu,"Max A, Schumm/AAL-8180-2021","Max A, Schumm/0000-0001-9694-4185; Myers, Bethany/0000-0002-4137-6245",,,,,68,12,12,5,17,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Parents are often uncertain about how, when, and what to tell their children about the condition, and are fearful of the effect on their family. There is evidence that children are often aware that something is seriously wrong and want honest information. Health-care professionals have a key role in supporting and guiding parents and caregivers to communicate with their children about the diagnosis. However, the practical and emotional challenges of communicating with families are compounded by a scarcity of evidence-based guidelines. This Review considers children's awareness and understanding of their parents' condition, the effect of communication around parental life-threatening condition on their wellbeing, factors that influence communication, and the challenges to achieving effective communication. Children's and parents' preferences about communication are outlined. An expert workshop was convened to generate principles for health-care professionals, intended as practical guidance in the current absence of empirically derived guidelines.","[Dalton, Louise; Rapa, Elizabeth; Hanington, Lucy; Stein, Alan; Fazel, M.] Univ Oxford, Dept Psychiat, Oxford OX3 7JX, England; [Kelly, Brenda] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Womens & Reprod Hlth, Oxford, England; [Ziebland, Sue] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Primary Care Hlth Sci, Oxford, England; [Bland, Ruth; Stein, Alan] Univ Witwatersrand, Fac Hlth Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Rochat, Tamsen] Univ Witwatersrand, Fac Hlth Sci, Sch Clin Med, Dept Paediat, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Stein, K.

Prevalence of gestational diabetes in the US has been estimated at 5.8% to 9.2%, based on traditional diagnostic criteria, although it may be higher if more inclusive criteria are used. Pregnant persons with gestational diabetes are at increased risk for maternal and fetal complications, including preeclampsia, fetal macrosomia (which can cause shoulder dystocia and birth injury), and neonatal hypoglycemia. Gestational diabetes has also been associated with an increased risk of several long-term health outcomes in pregnant persons and intermediate outcomes in their offspring. OBJECTIVE The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the accuracy, benefits, and harms of screening for gestational diabetes and the benefits and harms of treatment for the pregnant person and infant. POPULATION Pregnant persons who have not been previously diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit to screening for gestational diabetes at 24 weeks of gestation or after to improve maternal and fetal outcomes. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on screening for gestational diabetes before 24 weeks of gestation is insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms of screening cannot be determined. RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF recommends screening for gestational diabetes in asymptomatic pregnant persons at 24 weeks of gestation or after. (B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for gestational diabetes in asymptomatic pregnant persons before 24 weeks of gestation.

Although the security sector is a key partner in many specific public health programmes, its identity as an important part of the public health endeavour is rarely recognised. This absence of recognition has resulted in a generally inadequate approach to research and investigation of ways in which law enforcement, especially police at both operational and strategic levels, can be effectively engaged to actively promote and protect public health as part of a broader multisectoral public health effort. However, the challenge remains to engage police to consider their role as one that serves a public health function. The challenge consists of overcoming the continuous and competitive demand for police to do so-called policing, rather than serve a broader public health function often derogatively referred to as social work. This Series paper explores the intersect between law enforcement and public health at the global and local levels and argues that public health is an integral aspect of public safety and security. Recognition of this role of public health is the first step towards encouraging a joined-up approach to dealing with entrenched social, security, and health issues.","[van Dijk, Auke J.] Police Netherlands, The Hague, Netherlands; [Herrington, Victoria] Australian Inst Police Management, Sydney, NSW 2095, Australia; [Crofts, Nick] Ctr Law Enforcement & Publ Hlth, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Breunig, Robert; Sullivan, Helen] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Burris, Scott] Temple Univ, Ctr Publ Hlth Law Res, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Middleton, John] Fac Publ Hlth, London, England; [Sherman, Susan] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Behav & Soc, Baltimore, MD USA; [Thomson, Nicholas] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Publ Hlth & Human Rights, Baltimore, MD USA; [Thomson, Nicholas] Univ Melbourne, Nossal Inst Global Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Thomson, Nicholas] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,"Herrington, V (corresponding author), Australian Inst Police Management, Sydney, NSW 2095, Australia.",vherrington@aipm.gov.au,,"van Dijk, Auke/0000-0003-1386-5292; Sullivan, Helen/0000-0001-8087-7432; Breunig, Robert/0000-0002-2220-3410",,,,,49,24,25,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,JAN 19,2019,393,10168,,,,,287,294,,10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32839-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32839-3,,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),General & Internal Medicine,HH8RN,30663598,,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000456000000032,View Full Record in Web of Science,42487,0,21,22,12,6,37,36,49,9,38,33,14,45,5,7,30

OBJECTIVE To demonstrate the potential utility of Bayesian analyses by estimating the posterior probability, under various assumptions, that early ECMO was associated with reduced mortality in patients with very severe ARDS in a randomized clinical trial (RCT). DESIGN AND EVIDENCE A post hoc Bayesian analysis of data from an RCT (ECMO to Rescue Lung Injury in Severe ARDS [EOLIA]) that included 249 patients with very severe ARDS who had been randomized to receive early ECMO (n = 124; mortality at 60 days, 35%) vs initial conventional lung-protective ventilation with the option for rescue ECMO (n = 125, mortality at 60 days, 46%). The trial was designed to detect an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 20%, relative risk (RR) of 0.67. Statistical prior distributions were specified to represent varying levels of preexisting enthusiasm or skepticism for ECMO and by Bayesian meta-analysis of previously published studies (with downweighting to account for differences and quality between studies). The RR, credible interval (Crl), ARR, and probability of clinically important mortality benefit (varying from RR less than 1 to RR less than 0.67 and ARR from 2% or more to 20% or more) were estimated with Bayesian modeling. FINDINGS Combining a minimally informative prior distribution with the findings of the EOLIA trial, the posterior probability of RR less than 1 for mortality at 60 days after randomization was 96%(RR, 0.78 [95% Crl, 0.56-1.04]); the posterior probability of RR less than 0.67 was 18%, the probability of ARR of 2% or more was 92%, and the probability of ARR of 20% or more was 2%. With a moderately enthusiastic prior, equivalent to information from a trial of 264 patients with an RR of 0.78, the estimated RR was 0.78 (95% Crl, 0.63-0.96), the probability of RR less than 1 was 99%, the probability of RR less than 0.67 was 8%, the probability of ARR of 2% or more was 97%, and the probability of ARR of 20% or more was 0%. With a strongly skeptical prior, equivalent to information from a trial of 264 patients with an RR of 1.0, the estimated RR was 0.88 (95% Crl, 0.71-1.09), the probability of RR less than 1 was 88%, the probability of RR less than 0.67 was 0%, the probability of ARR of 2% or more was 78%, and the probability of ARR of 20% or more was 0%. If the prior was informed by previous studies, the estimated RR was 0.71 (95% Crl, 0.55-0.94), the probability of RR less than 1 was 99%, the probability of RR less than 0.67 was 48%, the probability of ARR of 2% or more was 98%, and the probability of ARR of 20% or more was 4%. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Post hoc Bayesian analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial of early extracorporeal membrane oxygenation compared with conventional lung-protective ventilation with the option for rescue extracorporeal membrane oxygenation among patients with very severe acute respiratory distress syndrome provides information about the posterior probability of mortality benefit under a broad set of assumptions that may help inform interpretation of the study findings.","[Goligher, Ewan C.; Fan, Eddy; Slutsky, Arthur S.] Univ Toronto, Interdept Div Crit Care Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Goligher, Ewan C.; Tomlinson, George; Fan, Eddy] Univ Hlth Network, Dept Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Goligher, Ewan C.; Tomlinson, George] Toronto Gen Hosp, Res Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Tomlinson, George; Wijeysundera, Duminda N.; Fan, Eddy; Juni, Peter] Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Hajage, David] Sorbonne Univ, Hop Univ Pitie Salpetriere Charles Foix, AP HP,Ctr Pharmacoepidemiol, Dept Biostat Sante Publ & Informat Med,Unite Rech, Paris, France; [Wijeysundera, Duminda N.] Univ Toronto, Dept Anesthesia, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Wijeysundera, Duminda N.] Toronto Gen Hosp, Dept Anesthesia & Pain Management, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Wijeysundera, Duminda N.; Juni, Peter] Univ Toronto, St Michaels Hosp, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Inst, Appl Hlth Res Ctr,Dept Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Brodie, Daniel] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Div Pulm Allergy & Crit Care Med, New York, NY USA; [Brodie, Daniel] New York Presbyterian Hosp, New York, NY USA; [Slutsky, Arthur S.] St Michaels Hosp, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Inst, Keenan Ctr Biomed Res, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Combes, Alain] Sorbonne Univ, INSERM, Unite Mixte Rech, Inst Cardiometab & Nutr, Paris, France; [Combes, Alain] Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, AP HP, Inst Cardiol, Serv Med Intens Reanimat, Paris, France",,"Goligher, EC (corresponding author), Toronto Gen Hosp, 585 Univ Ave,Peter Munk Bldg,11th Floor,Room 192, Toronto, ON M5G 2N2, Canada.",ewan.goligher@utoronto.ca,"Juni, Peter/Q-8700-2016; Slutsky, Arthur/M-3325-2019; Wijeysundera, Duminda/L-3350-2018; Hajage, David/D-5226-2014; Tomlinson, George/L-5432-2016","Juni, Peter/0000-0002-5985-0670; Wijeysundera, Duminda/0000-0002-5897-8605; Hajage, David/0000-0002-8475-4090; Tomlinson, George/0000-0002-9328-6399; Goligher, Ewan/0000-0002-0990-6701",Canadian Institutes of Health Research; department of anesthesia at the University of Toronto,Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); department of anesthesia at the University of Toronto(University of Toronto),This work is supported by a new investigator award from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (Drs Fan and Wijeysundera) and a merit award from the department of anesthesia at the University of Toronto (Dr Wijeysundera).,,31,203,212,2,24,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

FindingsSystemic amyloidosis should be suspected in patients with nondiabetic proteinuria, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, unexplained peripheral neuropathy, or atypical monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. MeaningLate diagnosis of amyloidosis is a barrier to improved outcomes. Early recognition by primary care clinicians is vital for effective therapy to have a meaningful effect on survival. ImportanceMany patients with systemic amyloidosis are underdiagnosed. Overall, 25% of patients with immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis die within 6 months of diagnosis and 25% of patients with amyloid transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis die within 24 months of diagnosis. Effective therapy exists but is ineffective if end-organ damage is severe. ObjectiveTo provide evidence-based recommendations that could allow clinicians to diagnose this rare set of diseases earlier and enable accurate staging and counseling about prognosis. Evidence ReviewA comprehensive literature search was conducted by a reference librarian with publication dates from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2019. Key search terms included amyloid, amyloidosis, nephrotic syndrome, heart failure preserved ejection fraction, and peripheral neuropathy. Exclusion criteria included case reports, non-English-language text, and case series of fewer than 10 patients. The authors independently selected and appraised relevant literature. FindingsThere was a total of 1769 studies in the final data set. Eighty-one articles were included in this review, of which 12 were randomized clinical trials of therapy that included 3074 patients, 9 were case series, and 3 were cohort studies. The incidence of AL amyloidosis is approximately 12 cases per million persons per year and there is an estimated prevalence of 30000 to 45000 cases in the US and European Union. The incidence of variant ATTR amyloidosis is estimated to be 0.3 cases per year per million persons with a prevalence estimate of 5.2 cases per million persons. Wild-type ATTR is estimated to have a prevalence of 155 to 191 cases per million persons. Amyloidosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of adult nondiabetic nephrotic syndrome; heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, particularly if restrictive features are present; unexplained hepatomegaly without imaging abnormalities; peripheral neuropathy with distal sensory symptoms, such as numbness, paresthesia, and dysesthesias (although the autonomic manifestations occasionally may be the presenting feature); and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance with atypical clinical features. Staging can be performed using blood testing only. Therapeutic decision-making for AL amyloidosis involves choosing between high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant or bortezomib-based chemotherapy. There are 3 therapies approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for managing ATTR amyloidosis, depending on clinical phenotype. Conclusions and RelevanceAll forms of amyloidosis are underdiagnosed. All forms now have approved therapies that have been demonstrated to improve either survival or disability and quality of life. The diagnosis should be considered in patients that have a multisystem disorder involving the heart, kidney, liver, or nervous system. This systematic review summarizes the characteristic presentations, diagnosis, and management of immunoglobulin light chain (AL) and amyloid transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis.","[Gertz, Morie A.; Dispenzieri, Angela] Mayo Clin, Dept Med, Div Hematol, 200 First St SW,Mayo West 10, Rochester, MN 55905 USA",,"Gertz, MA (corresponding author), Mayo Clin, Dept Med, Div Hematol, 200 First St SW,Mayo West 10, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.",gertm@mayo.edu,,,,,,,79,46,49,2,12,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) works to improve the health of people nationwide by making evidence-based recommendations for preventive services. Patient-centered care is a core value in US health care. Shared decision-making (SDM), in which patients and clinicians make health decisions together, ensures patients' rights to be informed and involved in preventive care decisions and that these decisions are patient-centered. SDM has a role across the spectrum of USPSTF recommendations. For A or B recommendations (judged by the USPSTF to have high or moderate certainty of a moderate or substantial net benefit at the population level), SDM allows individual patients to decide whether to accept such services based on their personal values and preferences. For C recommendations (indicating at least moderate certainty of a small net benefit at the population level), SDM is critical for individual patients to decide whether the net benefit for them is worthwhile. For D recommendations (reflecting at least moderate certainty of a zero or negative net benefit) or I statements (low certainty of net benefit), clinicians should be prepared to discuss these services if patients ask. More evidence is needed to determine if, in addition to promoting patient-centeredness, SDM reduces inequities in preventive care, as well as to define new strategies to find time for discussion of preventive services in primary care.","[Davidson, Karina W.] Northwell Hlth, Feinstein Inst Med Res, New York, NY USA; [Mangione, Carol M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Barry, Michael J.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Nicholson, Wanda K.; Donahue, Katrina E.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Cabana, Michael D.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, New York, NY USA; [Caughey, Aaron B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Davis, Esa M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Doubeni, Chyke A.] Mayo Clin, Rochester, MN USA; [Kubik, Martha] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Li, Li] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Ogedegbe, Gbenga] NYU Grossman Sch Med, New York, NY USA; [Pbert, Lori] Univ Massachusetts, Med Sch, Worcester, MA USA; [Silverstein, Michael] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Stevermer, James] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Univ Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Pacific Hlth Res & Educ Inst, Honolulu, HI USA; [Wong, John B.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02111 USA",,"Barry, MJ (corresponding author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Gen Internal Med Div, 100 Cambridge St,16th Floor, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",mbarry@mgh.harvard.edu,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,0,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

High-risk subtypes of the human papilloma virus (HPV) are the cause of the disease in most cases. The disease is largely preventable. Approximately 90% of cervical cancers occur in low-income and middle-income countries that lack organised screening and HPV vaccination programmes. In high-income countries, cervical cancer incidence and mortality have more than halved over the past 30 years since the introduction of formal screening programmes. Treatment depends on disease extent at diagnosis and locally available resources, and might involve radical hysterectomy or chemoradiation, or a combination of both. Conservative, fertility-preserving surgical procedures have become standard of care for women with low-risk, early-stage disease. Advances in radiotherapy technology, such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy, have resulted in less treatment-related toxicity for women with locally-advanced disease. For women with metastatic or recurrent disease, the overall prognosis remains poor; nevertheless, the incorporation of the anti-VEGF agent bevacizumab has been able to extend overall survival beyond 12 months. Preliminary results of novel immunotherapeutic approaches, similarly to other solid tumours, have shown promising results so far.","[Cohen, Paul A.] St John God Subiaco Hosp, Bendat Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Gynaecol Oncol, Subiaco, WA 6008, Australia; [Cohen, Paul A.] Univ Western Australia, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Div Obstet & Gynaecol, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Jhingran, Anjua] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Radiat Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Oaknin, Ana] Vall dHebron Univ Hosp, Med Oncol Dept, Gynaecol Tumour Unit, VHIO, Barcelona, Spain; [Denny, Lynette] Univ Cape Town, Dept Obstet & Gynaecol, Cape Town, South Africa; [Denny, Lynette] South African Med Res Council, Gynaecol Canc Res Ctr, Tygerberg, South Africa",,"Cohen, PA (corresponding author), St John God Subiaco Hosp, Bendat Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Gynaecol Oncol, Subiaco, WA 6008, Australia.",paul.cohen@uwa.edu.au,"Cohen, Paul A/AAC-8199-2022","Cohen, Paul A/0000-0002-4860-9232; OAKNIN, ANA/0000-0002-3592-7194",,,,,114,655,694,56,350,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,JAN 12,2019,393,10167,,,,,169,182,,10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32470-X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32470-X,,,14,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,HH0VD,30638582,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000455437100030,View Full Record in Web of Science,43222,0,96,42,111,76,99,85,84,110,108,44,92,113,74,76,78

OBSERVATIONS Peripheral artery disease is uncommon before aged 50 years but affects up to 20% of people aged 80 years and older. It can be noninvasively diagnosed with the ankle-brachial index (ABI), a ratio of Doppler-recorded pressures in the dorsalis pedis and/or posterior tibial artery in each leg to brachial artery pressures. An ABI value less than 0.90 is 57% to 79% sensitive and 83% to 99% specific for arterial stenosis of at least 50%. Intermittent claudication, consisting of exertional calf pain that does not begin at rest and that resolves within 10 minutes of rest, is considered the classic symptom of PAD. However, 70% to 90% of people with an ABI value less than 0.90 either report no exertional leg symptoms (ie, asymptomatic) or report leg symptoms with walking that are not consistent with classic claudication. Over time, people with PAD restrict walking activity or slow walking speed to avoid leg symptoms. Thus, although approximately 75% of people with PAD report no change in leg symptoms over time, those with PAD have significantly greater annual declines in 6-minute walk performance compared with those without it. Approximately 11% of people with PAD develop chronic limb-threatening ischemia, the most severe form of PAD. Compared with people without PAD, those with the disease have approximately twice the rate of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and major coronary events at 10-year follow-up. High-dose statins and antiplatelet therapy with or without antithrombotic therapy reduced rates of coronary events and stroke in people with PAD. Supervised treadmill exercise improved 6-minute walk distance by 30 to 35 m, consistent with a clinically meaningful change, whereas effective home-based walking exercise interventions improved 6-minute walk by 42 to 53 m. Effective home-based exercise programs require behavioral methods, including monitoring by a coach. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Peripheral artery disease affects approximately 230 million people worldwide and is associated with increased rates of cardiovascular events, lower extremity events, and functional decline compared with that of people without PAD. People with PAD should be treated with the highest dose of statin tolerated, antithrombotic and/or antiplatelet therapy, and exercise.","[Polonsky, Tamar S.] Univ Chicago Med, Dept Med, Chicago, IL USA; [McDermott, Mary M.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA",,"McDermott, MM (corresponding author), 750 N Lake Shore Dr,10th Floor, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",mdm608@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,93,11,11,0,1,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Approximately 0.9% of the 4 million births in the United States annually are complicated by preexisting diabetes. OBSERVATIONS Women with diabetes have increased risk for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, and similar risks are present with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Both forms of diabetes require similar intensity of diabetes care. Preconception planning is very important to avoid unintended pregnancies and to minimize risk of congenital defects. Hemoglobin Ak goals are less than 6.5% at conception and less than 6.0% during pregnancy. It is also critical to screen for and manage comorbid illnesses, such as retinopathy and nephropathy. Medications known to be unsafe in pregnancy, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins, should be discontinued. Women with obesity should be screened for obstructive sleep apnea, which is often undiagnosed and can result in poor outcomes. Blood pressure goals must be considered carefully because lower treatment thresholds may be required for women with nephropathy. During pregnancy, continuous glucose monitoring can improve glycemic control and neonatal outcomes in women with type 1 diabetes. Insulin is first-line therapy for all women with preexisting diabetes; injections and insulin pump therapy are both effective approaches. Rates of severe hypoglycemia are increased during pregnancy; therefore, glucagon should be available to the patient and close contacts should be trained in its use. Low-dose aspirin is recommended soon after 12 weeks' gestation to minimize the risk of preeclampsia. The importance of discussing long-acting reversible contraception before and after pregnancy, to allow for appropriate preconception planning, cannot be overstated. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Preexisting diabetes in pregnancy is complex and is associated with significant maternal and neonatal risk. Optimization of glycemic control, medication regimens, and careful attention to comorbid conditions can help mitigate these risks and ensure quality diabetes care before, during, and after pregnancy.","[Alexopoulos, Anastasia-Stefania] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Durham, NC USA; [Blair, Rachel] Brigham & Womens Hosp, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Peters, Anne L.] Univ Southern Calif, Keck Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA USA",,"Peters, AL (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Keck Sch Med, USC Clin Diabet Program, 9033 Wilshire Blvd,Ste 406, Los Angeles, CA 90211 USA.",annepete@med.usc.edu,,"Blair, Rachel/0000-0002-1456-3336","National Institutes of Health [T32DK007012, T32HL007609]; NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE [T32HL007609] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES [T32DK007012] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK))",This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health awards T32DK007012 (Dr Alexopoulos) and T32HL007609 (Dr Blair).,,88,44,49,1,14,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Surveillance by biannual ultrasound is recommended for such patients because it allows diagnosis at an early stage, when effective therapies are feasible. The best candidates for resection are patients with a solitary tumour and preserved liver function. Liver transplantation benefits patients who are not good candidates for surgical resection, and the best candidates are those within Milan criteria (solitary tumour <= 5 cm or up to three nodules <= 3 cm). Image-guided ablation is the most frequently used therapeutic strategy, but its efficacy is limited by the size of the tumour and its localisation. Chemoembolisation has survival benefit in asymptomatic patients with multifocal disease without vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread. Finally, sorafenib, lenvatinib, which is non-inferior to sorafenib, and regorafenib increase survival and are the standard treatments in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

The number of persons 60 years or older with impaired visual acuity (defined as best corrected visual acuity worse than 20/40 but better than 20/200) was estimated at 2.91 million in 2015, and the number who are blind (defined as best corrected visual acuity of 20/200 or worse) was estimated at 760 000. Impaired visual acuity is consistently associated with decreased quality of life in older persons, including reduced ability to perform activities of daily living, work, and drive safely, as well as increased risk of falls and other unintentional injuries. OBJECTIVE To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for impaired visual acuity in older adults. POPULATION Asymptomatic adults 65 years or older who present in primary care without known impaired visual acuity and are not seeking care for vision problems. EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for impaired visual acuity in asymptomatic older adults. The evidence is lacking, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. More research is needed. RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for impaired visual acuity in older adults.

In an era in which the need for greater research transparency is paramount, inadequate reporting hinders assessment of the reliability and validity of trial findings. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 Statement was developed to improve the reporting of randomized clinical trials, but the primary focus was on parallel-group trials with 2 groups. Multi-arm trials that use a parallel-group design (comparing treatments by concurrently randomizing participants to one of the treatment groups, usually with equal probability) but have 3 or more groups are relatively common. The quality of reporting of multi-arm trials varies substantially, making judgments and interpretation difficult. While the majority of the elements of the CONSORT 2010 Statement apply equally to multi-arm trials, some elements need adaptation, and, in some cases, additional issues need to be clarified. OBJECTIVE To present an extension to the CONSORT 2010 Statement for reporting multi-arm trials to facilitate the reporting of such trials. DESIGN A guideline writing group, which included all authors, formed following the CONSORT group meeting in 2014. The authors met in person and by teleconference bimonthly between 2014 and 2018 to develop and revise the checklist and the accompanying text, with additional discussions by email. A draft manuscript was circulated to the wider CONSORT group of 36 individuals, plus 5 other selected individuals known for their specialist knowledge in clinical trials, for review. Extensive feedback was received from 14 individuals and, after detailed consideration of their comments, a final revised version of the extension was prepared. FINDINGS This CONSORT extension for multi-arm trials expands on 10 items of the CONSORT 2010 checklist and provides examples of good reporting and a rationale for the importance of each extension item. Key recommendations are that multi-arm trials should be identified as such and require clear objectives and hypotheses referring to all of the treatment groups. Primary treatment comparisons should be identified and authors should report the planned and unplanned comparisons resulting from multiple groups completely and transparently. If statistical adjustments for multiplicity are applied, the rationale and method used should be described. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This extension of the CONSORT 2010 Statement provides specific guidance for the reporting of multi-arm parallel-group randomized clinical trials and should help provide greater transparency and accuracy in the reporting of such trials.","[Juszczak, Edmund] Univ Oxford, NPEU Clin Trials Unit, Natl Perinatal Epidemiol Unit, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Old Rd Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, England; [Altman, Douglas G.; Hopewell, Sally] Univ Oxford, Ctr Stat Med, Nuffield Dept Orthopaed Rheumatol & Musculoskelet, Oxford, England; [Schulz, Kenneth] FHI 360, Durham, NC USA; [Schulz, Kenneth] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA",,"Juszczak, E (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, NPEU Clin Trials Unit, Natl Perinatal Epidemiol Unit, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Old Rd Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, England.",ed.juszczak@npeu.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,43,67,66,1,5,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Relative to other high-income countries, the UK is lagging on many health outcomes, such as life expectancy and infant mortality, and there is a growing burden of mental illness. Successes exist, such as the striking improvements in oral health, but inequalities in health persist as well. The growth of the ageing population relative to the working-age population, the rise of multimorbidity, and persistent health inequalities, particularly for preventable illness, are all issues that the National Health Service (NHS) will face in the years to come. Meeting the challenges of the future will require an increased focus on health promotion and disease prevention, involving a more concerted effort to understand and tackle the multiple social, environmental, and economic factors that lie at the heart of health inequalities. The immediate priority of the NHS will be to mitigate the wider and long-term health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it must also strengthen its resilience to reduce the impact of other threats to health, such as the UK leaving the EU, climate change, and antimicrobial resistance.","[McKee, Martin] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, London, England; [Charlesworth, Anita] Hlth Fdn, London, England; [Anderson, Michael; Johnston-Webber, Charlotte; Knapp, Martin; McGuire, Alistair] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Hlth Policy, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Brayne, Carol] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Publ Hlth, Cambridge, England; [Charlesworth, Anita] Univ Birmingham, Coll Social Sci, Hlth Serv Management Ctr, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Newton, John N.] Publ Hlth England, London, England; [Taylor, David] UCL, UCL Sch Pharm, London, England; [Watt, Richard G.] UCL, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, London, England",,"Anderson, M (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Hlth Policy, London WC2A 2AE, England.",m.anderson5@lse.ac.uk,,"Newton, John/0000-0002-5641-6457; Brayne, Carol/0000-0001-5307-663X; Watt, Richard/0000-0001-6229-8584",LSE Knowledge and Exchange Impact (KEI) fund from the Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF),LSE Knowledge and Exchange Impact (KEI) fund from the Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF),"Funding for the LSE-Lancet Commission on the future of the NHS was granted by the LSE Knowledge and Exchange Impact (KEI) fund, which was created using funds from the Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF).

Data from a nationally representative sample showed a prevalence of maternal HBV infection of 85.8 cases per 100000 deliveries from 1998 to 2011 (0.09% of live-born singleton deliveries in the United States). Although there are guidelines for universal infant HBV vaccination, rates of maternal HBV infection have increased annually by 5.5% since 1998. Children infected with HBV during infancy or childhood are more likely to develop chronic infection. Chronic HBV infection increases long-term morbidity and mortality by predisposing infected persons to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. ObjectiveTo update the 2009 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for HBV infection in pregnant women. Evidence ReviewThe USPSTF commissioned a reaffirmation evidence update to identify substantial new evidence sufficient enough to change the prior recommendation. The USPSTF targeted its evidence review on the effectiveness and potential harms of screening and the effectiveness and harms of case management to prevent perinatal transmission. FindingsThe USPSTF previously found adequate evidence that serologic testing for hepatitis B surface antigen accurately identifies HBV infection. Interventions are effective for preventing perinatal transmission, based on foundational evidence and observational studies of US case management programs. In addition, there is evidence that over time, perinatal transmission has decreased among women and infants enrolled in case management, providing an overall substantial health benefit. Therefore, the USPSTF reaffirms its previous conclusion that there is convincing evidence that screening for HBV infection in pregnant women provides substantial benefit. Conclusions and RecommendationThe USPSTF recommends screening for HBV infection in pregnant women at their first prenatal visit. (A recommendation) This 2019 Recommendation Statement from the US Preventive Services Task Force reaffirms the prior recommendation to screen pregnant women for hepatitis B virus infection at their first prenatal visit (A recommendation).","[Owens, Douglas K.] Stanford Univ, 616 Serra St,Encina Hall,Room C336, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Owens, Douglas K.] Vet Affairs Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Palo Alto, CA USA; [Davidson, Karina W.] Northwell Hlth, Feinstein Inst Med Res, Manhasset, NY USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Fairfax Family Practice Residency, Fairfax, VA USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Barry, Michael J.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Cabana, Michael] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Caughey, Aaron B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Doubeni, Chyke A.] Mayo Clin, Rochester, NY USA; [Epling, John W., Jr.] Virginia Tech, Caril Sch Med, Roanoke, VA USA; [Kemper, Alex R.] Nationwide Childrens Hosp, Columbus, OH USA; [Kubik, Martha] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Landefeld, C.

Importance Approximately 20 million new cases of bacterial or viral sexually transmitted infections (STIs) occur each year in the US, and about one-half of these cases occur in persons aged 15 to 24 years. Rates of chlamydial, gonococcal, and syphilis infection continue to increase in all regions. Sexually transmitted infections are frequently asymptomatic, which may delay diagnosis and treatment and lead persons to unknowingly transmit STIs to others. Serious consequences of STIs include pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, cancer, and AIDS. Objective To update its 2014 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a review of the evidence on the benefits and harms of behavioral counseling interventions for preventing STI acquisition. Population This recommendation statement applies to all sexually active adolescents and to adults at increased risk for STIs. Evidence Assessment The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that behavioral counseling interventions reduce the likelihood of acquiring STIs in sexually active adolescents and in adults at increased risk, including for example, those who have a current STI, do not use condoms, or have multiple partners, resulting in a moderate net benefit. Recommendation The USPSTF recommends behavioral counseling for all sexually active adolescents and for adults at increased risk for STIs.

These populations often have multiple overlapping risk factors and extreme levels of morbidity and mortality. We identified numerous interventions to improve physical and mental health, and substance use; however, evidence is scarce for structural interventions, including housing, employment, and legal support that can prevent exclusion and promote recovery.

This review provides an update on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, Mycoplasma genitalium, trichomoniasis, and genital herpes. OBSERVATIONS From 2015 to 2019, the rates of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis increased in the US; from 1999 to 2016, while the rates of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 declined. Populations with higher rates of STIs include people younger than 25 years, sexual and gender minorities such as men and transgender women who have sex with men, and racial and ethnic minorities such as Black and Latinx people. Approximately 70% of infections with HSV and trichomoniasis and 53% to 100% of extragenital gonorrhea and chlamydia infections are asymptomatic or associated with few symptoms. STIs are associated with HIV acquisition and transmission and are the leading cause of tubal factor infertility in women. Nucleic acid amplification tests have high sensitivities (86.1%-100%) and specificities (97.1%-100%) for the diagnosis of gonorrhea, chlamydia, M genitalium, trichomoniasis, and symptomatic HSV-1 and HSV-2. Serology remains the recommended method to diagnose syphilis, typically using sequential testing to detect treponemal and nontreponemal (antiphospholipid) antibodies. Ceftriaxone, doxycycline, penicillin, moxifloxacin, and the nitroimidazoles, such as metronidazole, are effective treatments for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, M genitalium, and trichomoniasis, respectively, but antimicrobial resistance limits oral treatment options for gonorrhea and M genitalium. No cure is available for genital herpes. Effective STI prevention interventions include screening, contact tracing of sexual partners, and promoting effective barrier contraception. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Approximately 1 in 5 adults in the US had an STI in 2018. Rates of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis in the US have increased, while rates of HSV-1 and HSV-2 have declined. Ceftriaxone, doxycycline, penicillin, moxifloxacin, and the nitroimidazoles are effective treatments for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and trichomoniasis, respectively, but antimicrobial resistance limits oral therapies for gonorrhea and Mycoplasma genitalium, and no cure is available for genital herpes.","[Tuddenham, Susan; Hamill, Matthew M.; Ghanem, Khalil G.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD USA",,"Ghanem, KG (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Bayview Med Ctr, 5200 Eastern Ave,MFL Ctr Tower 378, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA.",mdm608@northwestern.edu; kghanem@jhmi.edu,,"Hamill, Matthew M/0000-0002-1277-819X",National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [K23-AI125715],National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)),Dr Tuddenham is supported by grant K23-AI125715 from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.,,84,7,7,14,14,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

OBJECTIVE To update the 2016 review on screening for impaired visual acuity in older adults, to inform the USPSTF. DATA SOURCES Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (to February 2021); surveillance through January 21, 2022. STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials and controlled observational studies on screening, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors (wet AMD), and antioxidant vitamins and minerals (dry AMD); studies on screening diagnostic accuracy. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS One investigator abstracted data and a second checked accuracy. Two investigators independently assessed study quality. RESULTS Twenty-five studies (N = 33 586) were included (13 trials, 11 diagnostic accuracy studies, and 1 systematic review [19 trials]). Four trials (n = 4819) found no significant differences between screening vs no screening in visual acuity or other outcomes. Visual acuity tests (3 studies; n = 6493) and screening question (3 studies; n = 5203) were associated with suboptimal diagnostic accuracy. For wet AMD, 4 trials (n = 2086) found VEGF inhibitors significantly associated with greater likelihood of 15 or more letters visual acuity gain (risk ratio [RR], 2.92 [95% CI, 1.20-7.12]; I-2 = 76%; absolute risk difference [ARD], 10%) and less than 15 letters visual acuity loss (RR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.22-1.75]; I-2 = 80%; ARD, 27%) vs sham treatment, with no increased risk of serious harms. For dry AMD, a systematic review (19 trials) found antioxidant multivitamins significantly associated with decreased risk of progression to late AMD (3 trials, n = 2445; odds ratio [OR], 0.72 [95% CI, 0.58-0.90]) and 3 lines or more visual acuity loss (1 trial, n = 1791; OR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.62-0.96]) vs placebo. Zinc was significantly associated with increased risk of genitourinary events and beta carotene with increased risk of lung cancer in former smokers; other serious harms were infrequent. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This review found that effective treatments are available for common causes of impaired visual acuity in older adults. However, direct evidence found no significant association between vision screening vs no screening in primary care and improved visual outcomes.","[Chou, Roger; Bougatsos, Christina; Jungbauer, Rebecca; Grusing, Sara; Blazina, Ian; Selph, Shelley] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Northwest Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Dept Med Informat & Clin Epidemiol, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Selph, Shelley] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Family Med, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Jonas, Daniel E.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Internal Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Jonas, Daniel E.] Univ N Carolina, Evidence Based Practice Ctr, RTI Int, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Tehrani, Shandiz] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Casey Eye Inst, Dept Ophthalmol, Portland, OR 97201 USA",,"Chou, R (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd,Mail Code BICC, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",chour@ohsu.edu,,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA-290-2015-00011-I, 75Q80119F32015]; US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services; US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)","This research was funded under contract HHSA-290-2015-00011-I, Task Order 75Q80119F32015, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).",,79,4,4,0,0,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

New evidence from recent large randomized clinical trials warrants an update of previous meta-analyses. OBJECTIVE To conduct ameta-analysis of the association of thyroid hormone therapy with quality of life and thyroid-related symptoms in adults with subclinical hypothyroidism. DATA SOURCES PubMed, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CENTRAL, Emcare, and Academic Search Premier from inception until July 4, 2018. STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials that compared thyroid hormone therapy with placebo or no therapy in nonpregnant adults with subclinical hypothyroidism were eligible. Two reviewers independently evaluated eligibility based on titles and abstracts of all retrieved studies. Studies not excluded in this first step were independently assessed for inclusion after full-text evaluation by 2 reviewers. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two independent reviewers extracted data, assessed risk of bias (Cochrane risk-of-bias tool), and evaluated the quality of evidence (GRADE tool). For synthesis, differences in clinical scores were transformed (eg, quality of life) into standardized mean differences (SMDs; positive values indicate benefit of thyroid hormone therapy; 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 correspond to small, moderate, and large effects, respectively). Random-effects models formeta-analyses were applied. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES General quality of life and thyroid-related symptoms after a minimum follow-up of 3 months. RESULTS Overall, 21 of 3088 initially identified publications met the inclusion criteria, with 2192 adults randomized. After treatment (range, 3-18 months), thyroid hormone therapy was associated with lowering the mean thyrotropin value into the normal reference range compared with placebo (range, 0.5-3.7 mIU/L vs 4.6 to 14.7 mIU/L) but was not associated with benefit regarding general quality of life (n = 796; SMD, -0.11; 95% CI, -0.25 to 0.03; I-2 = 66.7%) or thyroid-related symptoms (n = 858; SMD, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.12 to 0.14; I-2 = 0.0%). Overall, risk of bias was low and the quality of evidence assessed with the GRADE tool was judged moderate to high. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among nonpregnant adults with subclinical hypothyroidism, the use of thyroid hormone therapy was not associated with improvements in general quality of life or thyroid-related symptoms. These findings do not support the routine use of thyroid hormone therapy in adults with subclinical hypothyroidism.","[Feller, Martin; Moutzouri, Elisavet; de Montmollin, Maria; Aujesky, Drahomir; Rodondi, Nicolas] Univ Bern, Univ Hosp Bern, Dept Gen Internal Med, Inselspital, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland; [Feller, Martin; Moutzouri, Elisavet; de Montmollin, Maria; Rodondi, Nicolas] Univ Bern, Inst Primary Hlth Care, Bern, Switzerland; [Feller, Martin; Snel, Marieke; Gussekloo, Jacobijn; Mooijaart, Simon; Dekkers, Olaf M.] Leiden Univ Ctr, Dept Endocrinol Gen Internal Med, Leiden, Netherlands; [Bauer, Douglas C.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA USA; [Bauer, Douglas C.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Ford, Ian] Univ Glasgow, Inst Hlth & Wellbeing, Robertson Ctr Biostat, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Gussekloo, Jacobijn] Leiden Univ Ctr, Dept Publ Hlth & Primary Care, Leiden, Netherlands; [Kearney, Patricia M.] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Publ Hlth, Cork, Ireland; [Mooijaart, Simon] Leiden Univ Ctr, Inst Evidence Based Med Old Age, Leiden, Netherlands; [Quinn, Terry; Stott, David] Univ Glasgow, Inst Cardiovasc Med, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Westendorp, Rudi] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Publ Hlth, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Westendorp, Rudi] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Hlth Aging, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Dekkers, Olaf M.] Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Clin Epidemiol, Leiden, Netherlands; [Dekkers, Olaf M.] Aarhus Univ Hosp, Dept Clin Epidemiol, Aarhus, Denmark",,"Feller, M (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Univ Hosp Bern, Dept Gen Internal Med, Inselspital, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland.",martin.feller@insel.ch,"Mooijaart, Simon P./A-5306-2008; Ford, Ian/ABE-6145-2020; Tharmapoopathy, Mathuri/B-6636-2019; Gussekloo, Jacobijn/ABE-3879-2021; Quinn, Terence Joseph/H-7000-2019; Kearney, Patricia M/AAE-8501-2020","Mooijaart, Simon P./0000-0003-3106-3568; Gussekloo, Jacobijn/0000-0001-7186-8278; Quinn, Terence Joseph/0000-0003-1401-0181; Rodondi, Nicolas/0000-0001-9083-6896; Kearney, Patricia/0000-0001-9599-3540",Swiss National Science Foundation [SNSF 320030_172676],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission),The Swiss National Science Foundation funded this study (grant SNSF 320030_172676 to Dr Rodondi).,,61,114,117,1,18,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Now that most of the genes responsible for these conditions have been identified, it is possible to accurately diagnose them and implement subtype-specific anticipatory care, as complications such as cardiac and respiratory muscle involvement vary greatly. This development and advances in the field of supportive medicine have changed the standard of care, with an overall improvement in the clinical course, survival, and quality of life of affected individuals. The improved understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases is being used for the development of novel therapies. In the most common form, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a few personalised therapies have recently achieved conditional approval and many more are at advanced stages of clinical development. In this Seminar, we concentrate on clinical manifestations, molecular pathogenesis, diagnostic strategy, and therapeutic developments for this group of conditions.","[Mercuri, Eugenio] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore Roma, Pediat Neurol Unit, Rome, Italy; [Mercuri, Eugenio] Fdn Policlin Univ Gemelli IRCCS, Nemo Clin Ctr, Rome, Italy; [Bonnemann, Carsten G.] NINDS, Neuromuscular & Neurogenet Disorders Childhood Se, NIH, Bldg 36,Rm 4D04, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Muntoni, Francesco] UCL, Dubowitz Neuromuscular Ctr, Great Ormond St Inst Child Hlth, London WC1N 1EH, England; [Muntoni, Francesco] Great Ormond St Hosp Sick Children, Biomed Res Ctr, Natl Inst Hlth Res, London, England",,"Muntoni, F (corresponding author), UCL, Dubowitz Neuromuscular Ctr, Great Ormond St Inst Child Hlth, London WC1N 1EH, England.",f.muntoni@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,113,101,104,8,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,NOV 30,2019,394,10213,,,,,2025,2038,,,,,,14,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,JT4GR,31789220,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000500950200029,View Full Record in Web of Science,44518,0,77,7,29,23,107,62,112,3,78,21,103,80,56,54,95

Symptoms include fever, maculopapular rash, and at least one of cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis, although vaccinated individuals can have milder or even no symptoms. Laboratory diagnosis relies largely on the detection of specific IgM antibodies in serum, dried blood spots, or oral fluid, or the detection of viral RNA in throat or nasopharyngeal swabs, urine, or oral fluid. Complications can affect many organs and often include otitis media, laryngotracheobronchitis, pneumonia, stomatitis, and diarrhoea. Neurological complications are uncommon but serious, and can occur during or soon after the acute disease (eg, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) or months or even years later (eg, measles inclusion body encephalitis and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis). Patient management mainly involves supportive therapy, such as vitamin A supplementation, monitoring for and treatment of secondary bacterial infections with antibiotics, and rehydration in the case of severe diarrhoea. There is no specific antiviral therapy for the treatment of measles, and disease control largely depends on prevention. However, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine, measles is still endemic in many countries and causes considerable morbidity and mortality, especially among children in resource-poor settings. The low case numbers reported in 2020, after a worldwide resurgence of measles between 2017 and 2019, have to be interpreted cautiously, owing to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on disease surveillance. Disrupted vaccination activities during the pandemic increase the potential for another resurgence of measles in the near future, and effective, timely catch-up vaccination campaigns, strong commitment and leadership, and sufficient resources will be required to mitigate this threat.","[Hubschen, Judith M.] Luxembourg Inst Hlth, Dept Infect & Immun, L-4354 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Gouandjika-Vasilache, Ionela] Inst Pasteur, Lab Virus Enter & Rougeole, Bangui, Cent Afr Republ; [Dina, Julia] Normandie Univ, Caen Univ Hosp, Virol Dept, UNICAEN,INSERM U1311 DynaMicURe, Caen, France",,"Hubschen, JM (corresponding author), Luxembourg Inst Hlth, Dept Infect & Immun, L-4354 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg.",judith.huebschen@lih.lu,,,,,,,142,3,3,13,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,FEB,2022,399,10325,,,,,678,690,,10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02004-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02004-3,,,13,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,YY1RO,35093206,,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000754571600026,View Full Record in Web of Science,44531,0,111,138,57,28,88,19,32,73,116,97,137,121,122,12,63

Acute presentation with full blown nephritic syndrome or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is uncommon and is mainly restricted to patients with postinfectious glomerulonephritis, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies-associated vasculitis, and anti-glomerular basement membrane disease. Most frequently, patients present with asymptomatic haematuria and proteinuria with or without reduced kidney function. All glomerulonephritis disorders can show periods of exacerbation, but disease flairs characteristically occur in patients with IgA nephropathy or C3 glomerulopathy. The gold standard for the diagnosis of a glomerulonephritis is a kidney biopsy, with a hallmark glomerular inflammation that translates into various histopathological patterns depending on the location and severity of the glomerular injury. Traditionally, glomerulonephritis was classified on the basis of the different histopathological patterns of injury. In the last few years, substantial progress has been made in unravelling the underlying causes and pathogenetic mechanisms of glomerulonephritis and a causal approach to the classification of glomerulonephritis is now favoured over a patternbased approach. As such, glomerulonephritis can be broadly classified as immune-complex glomerulonephritis (including infection-related glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and cryoglobulinaemic glomerulonephritis), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies-associated (pauci-immune) glomerulonephritis, antiglomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis, C3 glomerulopathy, and monoclonal immunoglobulinassociated glomerulonephritis. We provide an overview of the clinical presentation, pathology, and the current therapeutic approach of the main representative disorders in the spectrum of glomerulonephritis.","[Sethi, Sanjeev] Mayo Clin, Dept Lab Med & Pathol, Rochester, MN USA; [Fervenza, Fernando C.] Mayo Clin, Div Nephrol & Hypertens, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [De Vriese, An S.] AZ Sint Jan Brugge, Div Nephrol & Infect Dis, Brugge, Belgium; [De Vriese, An S.] Univ Ghent, Dept Internal Med, Ghent, Belgium",,"Fervenza, FC (corresponding author), Mayo Clin, Div Nephrol & Hypertens, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.",fervenza.fernando@mayo.edu,,,Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology at the Mayo Clinic for the INNOV award,Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology at the Mayo Clinic for the INNOV award,SS acknowledges the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology at the Mayo Clinic for the INNOV award 2021.,,178,0,0,5,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,APR 23,2022,399,10335,,,,,1646,1663,,,,,,18,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,1G1JW,35461559,,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000795612300020,View Full Record in Web of Science,44535,0,139,90,25,160,116,66,64,128,32,168,81,93,161,70,9

OBJECTIVE To assess how social risks have been considered in USPSTF recommendation statements and identify current gaps in evidence needed to expand the systematic inclusion of social risks in future recommendations. EVIDENCE The USPSTF commissioned a technical brief that reviewed existing literature on screening and interventions for social risk factors and also audited the 85 USPSTF recommendation statements active as of December 2019 to determine how social risks were addressed in clinical preventive services recommendations. FINDINGS Among the 85 USPSTF recommendation statements reviewed, 14 were focused on preventive services that considered health-related social risks. Social risks were commonly referenced in parts of USPSTF recommendations, with 57 of 85 recommendations including some comment on social risks within the recommendation statement, although many comments were not separate prevention services. Social risks were commented on in USPSTF recommendations as part of risk assessment, as a marker of worse health outcomes from the condition of focus, as a consideration for clinicians when implementing the preventive service, and as a research need or gap on the topic. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This report identified how social risks have been considered in the USPSTF recommendation statements. It serves as a benchmark and foundation for ongoing work to advance the goal of ensuring that health equity and social risks are incorporated in USPSTF methods and recommendations.","[Davidson, Karina W.] Northwell Hlth, Feinstein Inst Med Res, Manhasset, NY USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Fairfax Family Practice Residency, Fairfax, VA USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, VA USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Univ Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Pacific Hlth Res & Educ Inst, Honolulu, HI USA; [Simon, Melissa] Northwestern Univ, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Doubeni, Chyke A.] Mayo Clin, Family Med & Ctr Hlth Equity & Community Engageme, Rochester, MN USA; [Kemper, Alex R.] Nationwide Childrens Hosp, Columbus, OH USA; [Kubik, Martha] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Ngo-Metzger, Quyen] Kaiser Permanente Bernard J Tyson Sch Med, Pasadena, CA USA; [Mills, Justin; Borsky, Amanda] Agcy Healthcare Res & Qual, Rockville, MD 20857 USA",,"Davidson, KW (corresponding author), Northwell Hlth, Feinstein Inst Med Res, 130 E 59th St,Ste 14C, New York, NY 10022 USA.",chair@uspstf.net,,"Kemper, Alex/0000-0001-5491-3997",,,,,28,9,8,0,2,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Previous systematic reviews have established benefits of low-dose aspirin taken during pregnancy to prevent preeclampsia and its sequelae. Objective To update evidence for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) on effectiveness of aspirin use in preventing preeclampsia in individuals at increased risk based on clinical risk factors or measurements associated with higher disease incidence than in the general population. Data Sources Studies from previous USPSTF review (2014), literature published January 2013 through May 15, 2020, in MEDLINE, PubMed (for publisher-supplied records only), EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Ongoing surveillance through January 22, 2021. Study Selection Good- and fair-quality randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy to prevent preeclampsia among individuals at increased risk; studies conducted in general populations to evaluate potential harms. Data Extraction and Synthesis Dual article screening and risk-of-bias assessment. Study data abstracted into prespecified forms, checked for accuracy. Random-effects meta-analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures Diagnosis of preeclampsia; adverse pregnancy health outcomes and complications including eclampsia, perinatal mortality, preterm birth, small for gestational age, and potential bleeding harms or infant/child harms from aspirin exposure. Results A total of 23 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (N = 26 952) were included; 18 were conducted among participants at increased preeclampsia risk. Aspirin dosages ranged from 50 mg/d to 150 mg/d. Most trials enrolled majority White populations selected based on a range of risk factors. The incidence of preeclampsia among the trials of participants at increased risk ranged from 4% to 30%. Aspirin use was significantly associated with lower risk of preeclampsia (pooled relative risk [RR], 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75-0.95]; 16 RCTs [n = 14 093]; I-2 = 0%), perinatal mortality (pooled RR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.66-0.96]; 11 RCTs [n = 13 860]; I-2 = 0%), preterm birth (pooled RR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.67-0.95]; 13 RCTs [n = 13 619]; I-2 = 49%), and intrauterine growth restriction (pooled RR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.68-0.99]; 16 RCTs [n = 14 385]; I-2 = 41%). There were no significant associations of aspirin use with risk of postpartum hemorrhage (pooled RR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.94-1.12]; 9 RCTs [n = 23 133]; I-2 = 0%) and other bleeding-related harms, or with rare perinatal or longer-term harms. Absolute risk reductions for preeclampsia associated with aspirin use ranged from -1% to -6% across larger trials (n >300) and were greater in smaller trials. For perinatal mortality, absolute risk reductions ranged from 0.5% to 1.1% in the 3 largest trials. Conclusions and Relevance Daily low-dose aspirin during pregnancy was associated with lower risks of serious perinatal outcomes for individuals at increased risk for preeclampsia, without evident harms. This systematic review to support the 2021 US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement on aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia and related morbidity and mortality summarizes published evidence on the benefits and harms of aspirin use in individuals at increased preeclampsia risk based on clinical risk factors or measurements associated with higher disease incidence.","[Henderson, Jillian T.; Vesco, Kimberly K.; Senger, Caitlyn A.; Thomas, Rachel G.; Redmond, Nadia] Kaiser Permanente, Ctr Hlth Res, Kaiser Permanente Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Portland, OR USA",,"Henderson, JT (corresponding author), Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Ctr Hlth Res, Kaiser Permanente Evidence Based Practice Ctr, 3800 N Interstate Ave, Portland, OR 97227 USA.",Jillian.T.Henderson@kpchr.org,,,,,,,96,13,13,4,10,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Regulators in numerous countries have authorised or approved COVID-19 vaccines for human use, with more expected to be licensed in 2021. Yet having licensed vaccines is not enough to achieve global control of COVID-19: they also need to be produced at scale, priced affordably, allocated globally so that they are available where needed, and widely deployed in local communities. In this Health Policy paper, we review potential challenges to success in each of these dimensions and discuss policy implications. To guide our review, we developed a dashboard to highlight key characteristics of 26 leading vaccine candidates, including efficacy levels, dosing regimens, storage requirements, prices, production capacities in 2021, and stocks reserved for low- income and middle-income countries. We use a traffic-light system to signal the potential contributions of each candidate to achieving global vaccine immunity, highlighting important trade-offs that policy makers need to consider when developing and implementing vaccination programmes. Although specific datapoints are subject to change as the pandemic response progresses, the dashboard will continue to provide a useful lens through which to analyse the key issues affecting the use of COVID-19 vaccines. We also present original data from a 32-country survey (n=26 758) on potential acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines, conducted from October to December, 2020.

Approximately 34 million people and an estimated 14% of adults in the US smoke cigarettes. If they stopped smoking, they could reduce their risk of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and potentially gain up to 10 years of life. OBSERVATIONS Tobacco smoking is a chronic disorder maintained by physical nicotine dependence and learned behaviors. Approximately 70% of people who smoke cigarettes want to quit smoking. However, individuals who attempt to quit smoking make an average of approximately 6 quit attempts before achieving long-term abstinence. Both behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy while using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products, varenicline, or bupropion are effective treatments when used individually, but they are most effective when combined. In ameta-analysis including 19 488 people who smoked cigarettes, the combination of medication and behavioral counseling was associated with a quit rate of 15.2% over 6 months compared with a quit rate of 8.6% with brief advice or usual care. The EAGLES trial, a randomized double-blind clinical trial of 8144 people who smoked, directly compared the efficacy and safety of varenicline, bupropion, nicotine patch, and placebo and found a significantly higher 6-month quit rate for varenicline (21.8%) than for bupropion (16.2%) and the nicotine patch (15.7%). Each therapy was more effective than placebo (9.4%). Combining a nicotine patch with other NRT products is more effective than use of a single NRT product. Combining drugs with different mechanisms of action, such as varenicline and NRT, has increased quit rates in some studies compared with use of a single product. Brief or intensive behavioral support can be delivered effectively in person or by telephone, textmessages, or the internet. The combination of a clinician's brief advice to quit and assistance to obtain tobacco cessation treatment is effective when routinely administered to tobacco users in virtually all health care settings. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Approximately 34 million people in the US smoke cigarettes and could potentially gain up to a decade of life expectancy by stopping smoking. First-line therapy should include both pharmacotherapy and behavioral support, with varenicline or combination NRT as preferred initial interventions.","[Rigotti, Nancy A.; Kruse, Gina R.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Tobacco Res & Treatment Ctr, Mongan Inst, Dept Med,Div Gen Internal Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Rigotti, Nancy A.; Kruse, Gina R.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Livingstone-Banks, Jonathan; Hartmann-Boyce, Jamie] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Primary Care Hlth Sci, Oxford, England",,"Rigotti, NA (corresponding author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, 100 Cambridge St,Ste 1600, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",rigotti.nancy@mgh.harvard.edu,,"Livingstone-Banks, Jonathan/0000-0002-3757-5591",NIHR via Cochrane Infrastructure,NIHR via Cochrane Infrastructure,"Dr Livingstone-Banks is funded by the NIHR, via Cochrane Infrastructure funding to the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group.",,78,4,4,5,5,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

This review summarizes evidence regarding cardiovascular risk assessment prior to noncardiac surgery. OBSERVATIONS Preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment requires a focused history and physical examination to identify signs and symptoms of ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and severe valvular disease. Risk calculators, such as the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, identify individuals with low risk (<1%) and higher risk (similar to 1%) for perioperative major adverse cardiovascular events during the surgical hospital admission or within 30 days of surgery. Cardiovascular testing is rarely indicated in patients at low risk for major adverse cardiovascular events. Stress testingmay be considered in patients at higher risk (determined by the inability to climb similar to 2 flights of stairs, which is <4 metabolic equivalent tasks) if the results from the testing would change the perioperative medical, anesthesia, or surgical approaches. Routine coronary revascularization does not reduce perioperative risk and should not be performed without specific indications independent of planned surgery. Routine perioperative use of low-dose aspirin (100mg/d) does not decrease cardiovascular events but does increase surgical bleeding. Statins are associated with fewer postoperative cardiovascular complications and lower mortality (1.8% vs 2.3% without statin use; P < .001) in observational studies, and should be considered preoperatively in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease undergoing vascular surgery. High-dose beta-blockers (eg, 100mg of metoprolol succinate) administered 2 to 4 hours prior to surgery are associated with a higher risk of stroke (1.0% vs 0.5% without beta-blocker use; P =.005) and mortality (3.1% vs 2.3% without beta-blocker use; P =.03) and should not be routinely used. There is a greater risk of perioperativemyocardial infarction and major adverse cardiovascular events in adults aged 75 years or older (9.5% vs 4.8% for younger adults; P <.001) and in patients with coronary stents (8.9% vs 1.5% for those without stents; P <.001) and these patients warrant careful preoperative consideration. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Comprehensive history, physical examination, and assessment of functional capacity during daily life should be performed prior to noncardiac surgery to assess cardiovascular risk. Cardiovascular testing is rarely indicated in patients with a low risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, but may be useful in patients with poor functional capacity (<4 metabolic equivalent tasks) undergoing high-risk surgery if test results would change therapy independent of the planned surgery. Perioperative medical therapy should be prescribed based on patient-specific risk.","[Smilowitz, Nathaniel R.; Berger, Jeffrey S.] NYU, Dept Med, Leon H Chamey Div Cardiol, Sch Med, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Smilowitz, Nathaniel R.] Vet Affairs New York Harbor Hlth Care Syst, Div Cardiol, Dept Med, New York, NY USA; [Berger, Jeffrey S.] NYU, Div Vasc Surg, Dept Surg, Sch Med, New York, NY 10016 USA",,"Smilowitz, NR (corresponding author), NYU, Sch Med, Ctr Prevent Cardiovasc Dis, 530 First Ave Skirball 9R, New York, NY 10016 USA.",jeffrey.berger@nyumc.org,,"Berger, Jeffrey/0000-0001-8216-4647","New York University Clinical and Translational Science Award; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health [UL1 TR001445, KL2 TR001446]; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health [R01HL139909, R35HL144993]","New York University Clinical and Translational Science Award; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)); National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI))","Dr Smilowitz was supported in part by a New York University Clinical and Translational Science Award and grants UL1 TR001445 and KL2 TR001446 from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health.

These activities seek to shape public and clinician beliefs about laboratory testing, the benefits and harms of prescription drugs, and some disease definitions. OBJECTIVE To review the marketing of prescription drugs, disease awareness campaigns, health services, and laboratory tests and the related consequences and regulation in the United States over a 20-year period (1997-2016). EVIDENCE Analysis (1997-2016) of consumer advertising (Kantar Media data for spending and number of ads); professional marketing (IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science, Open Payments Data [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services]); regulations and legal actions of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and US Department of Justice; and searches (1975-2018) of peer-reviewed medical literature (PubMed), business journals (Business Source Ultimate), and news media (Lexis Nexis) for articles about expenditures, content, and consequences and regulation of consumer and professional medical marketing. Spending is reported in 2016 dollars. FINDINGS From 1997 through 2016, spending on medical marketing of drugs, disease awareness campaigns, health services, and laboratory testing increased from $17.7 to $29.9 billion. The most rapid increasewas in direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising, which increased from $2.1 billion (11.9%) of total spending in 1997 to $9.6 billion (32.0%) of total spending in 2016. DTC prescription drug advertising increased from $1.3 billion (79000 ads) to $6 billion (4.6 million ads [including 663000 TV commercials]), with a shift toward advertising high-cost biologics and cancer immunotherapies. Pharmaceutical companies increased DTC marketing about diseases treated by their drugs with increases in disease awareness campaigns from 44 to 401 and in spending from $177 million to $430 million. DTC advertising for health services increased from $542 million to $2.9 billion, with the largest spending increases by hospitals, dental centers, cancer centers, mental health and addiction clinics, and medical services (eg, home health). DTC spending on advertising for laboratory tests (such as genetic testing) increased from $75.4 million to $82.6 million, although the number of ads increased more substantially (from 14 100 to 255 300), reflecting an increase in less expensive electronic media advertising. Marketing to health care professionals by pharmaceutical companies accounted for most promotional spending and increased from $15.6 billion to $20.3 billion, including $5.6 billion for prescriber detailing, $13.5 billion for free samples, $979 million for direct physician payments (eg, speaking fees, meals) related to specific drugs, and $59 million for disease education. Manufacturers of FDA-approved laboratory tests paid $12.9 million to professionals in 2016. From 1997 through 2016, the number of consumer and professional drug promotional materials that companies submitted for FDA review increased from 34 182 to 97 252, while FDA violation letters for misleading drug marketing decreased from 156 to 11. Since 1997, 103 financial settlements between drug companies and federal and state governments resulted in more than $11 billion in fines for off-label or deceptive marketing practices. The FTC has acted against misleading marketing by a single for-profit cancer center. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Medical marketing increased substantially from 1997 through 2016, especially DTC advertising for prescription drugs and health services. Pharmaceutical marketing to health professionals accounted for most spending and remains high even with new policies to limit industry influence. Despite the increase in marketing over 20 years, regulatory oversight remains limited.","[Schwartz, Lisa M.; Woloshin, Steven] Dartmouth Inst Hlth Policy & Clin Practice, Ctr Med Media, Lebanon, NH USA",,"Woloshin, S (corresponding author), Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Dartmouth Inst Hlth Policy & Clin Practice, WRTB, 1 Med Ctr Dr,Level 5, Lebanon, NH 03756 USA.",steven.woloshin@dartmouth.edu,,,,,,,114,127,128,14,116,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Bladder cancer ranges from unaggressive and usually noninvasive tumors that recur and commit patients to long-term invasive surveillance, to aggressive and invasive tumors with high disease-specific mortality. ObservationsAdvanced age, male sex, and cigarette smoking contribute to the development of bladder cancer. Bladder tumors can present with gross or microscopic hematuria, which is evaluated with cystoscopy and upper tract imaging depending on the degree of hematuria and risk of malignancy. Non-muscle-invasive tumors are treated with endoscopic resection and adjuvant intravesical therapy, depending on the risk classification. Enhanced cystoscopy includes technology used to improve the detection of tumors and can reduce the risk of recurrence. Patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive tumors that do not respond to adjuvant therapy with the standard-of-care immunotherapy, bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), constitute a challenging patient population to manage and many alternative therapies are being studied. For patients with muscle-invasive disease, more aggressive therapy with radical cystectomy and urinary diversion or trimodal therapy with maximal endoscopic resection, radiosensitizing chemotherapy, and radiation is warranted to curb the risk of metastasis and disease-specific mortality. Treatment of patients with advanced disease is undergoing rapid changes as immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors, targeted therapies, and antibody-drug conjugates have become options for certain patients with various stages of disease. Conclusions and RelevanceImproved understanding of the molecular biology and genetics of bladder cancer has evolved the way localized and advanced disease is diagnosed and treated. While intravesical BCG has remained the mainstay of therapy for intermediate and high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, the therapeutic options for muscle-invasive and advanced disease has expanded to include immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibition, targeted therapies, and antibody-drug conjugates. This narrative review summarizes recent advances in the diagnosis and management of bladder cancer, including updates on its epidemiology, pathophysiology, molecular biology, and developments in surgical procedures and targeted treatments.","[Lenis, Andrew T.; Lec, Patrick M.; Chamie, Karim] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Urol, Inst Urol Oncol IUO, 300 Stein Plaza,Ste 370, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Chamie, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Urol, Inst Urol Oncol IUO, 300 Stein Plaza,Ste 370, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",kchamie@mednet.ucla.edu,,,,,,,93,198,199,54,99,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

However, several surveys indicate that clinical adoption of these needles remains poor. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare patient outcomes after lumbar puncture with atraumatic needles and conventional needles. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we independently searched 13 databases with no language restrictions from inception to Aug 15, 2017, for randomised controlled trials comparing the use of atraumatic needles and conventional needles for any lumbar puncture indication. Randomised trials comparing atraumatic and conventional needles in which no dural puncture was done (epidural injections) or without a conventional needle control group were excluded. We screened studies and extracted data from published reports independently. The primary outcome of postdural-puncture headache incidence and additional safety and efficacy outcomes were assessed by random-effects and fixed-effects meta-analysis. This study is registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, number CRD42016047546. Findings We identified 20 241 reports; after exclusions, 110 trials done between 1989 and 2017 from 29 countries, including a total of 31 412 participants, were eligible for analysis. The incidence of postdural-puncture headache was significantly reduced from 11.0% (95% CI 9.1-13.3) in the conventional needle group to 4.2% (3.3-5.2) in the atraumatic group (relative risk 0.40, 95% CI 0.34-0.47, p<0.0001; I-2=45.4%). Atraumatic needles were also associated with significant reductions in the need for intravenous fluid or controlled analgesia (0.44, 95% CI 0.29-0.64; p<0.0001), need for epidural blood patch (0.50, 0.33-0.75; p=0.001), any headache (0.50, 0.43-0.57; p<0.0001), mild headache (0.52, 0.38-0.70; p<0.0001), severe headache (0.41, 0.28-0.59; p<0.0001), nerve root irritation (0.71, 0.54-0.92; p=0.011), and hearing disturbance (0.25, 0.11-0.60; p=0.002). Success of lumbar puncture on first attempt, failure rate, mean number of attempts, and the incidence of traumatic tap and backache did not differ significantly between the two needle groups. Prespecified subgroup analyses of postdural-puncture headache revealed no interactions between needle type and patient age, sex, use of prophylactic intravenous fluid, needle gauge, patient position, indication for lumbar puncture, bed rest after puncture, or clinician specialty. These results were rated high-quality evidence as examined using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation. Interpretation Among patients who had lumbar puncture, atraumatic needles were associated with a decrease in the incidence of postdural-puncture headache and in the need for patients to return to hospital for additional therapy, and had similar efficacy to conventional needles. These findings offer clinicians and stakeholders a comprehensive assessment and high-quality evidence for the safety and efficacy of atraumatic needles as a superior option for patients who require lumbar puncture.

In randomized trials, endovascular aortic aneurysm repair was associated with a lower risk of perioperative complications and death than open surgical repair, but mortality was similar after approximately 2 years. After endovascular repair, long-term imaging surveillance is recommended. Key Clinical Points Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm include advanced age, male sex, family history, previous or current use of tobacco, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. The risk is lower among patients with diabetes mellitus. Repair is recommended for male patients in whom the maximum diameter of the aneurysm is 5.5 cm or more and in female patients in whom the maximum diameter is 5.0 cm or more. The results of randomized, controlled trials indicate that endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is associated with a lower risk of perioperative complications and death than open surgical repair. The early advantage of EVAR over open surgery is maintained for an average of 2 to 3 years from the time the procedure was performed. There is no long-term advantage regarding survival. Although EVAR is associated with a higher risk of reintervention, most such interventions involve minor endovascular procedures. Over a patient's lifetime, open repair is associated with a higher risk of reintervention related to the laparotomy. Long-term imaging surveillance with duplex ultrasonography or computed tomographic angiography is recommended in patients who undergo EVAR.","[Schanzer, Andres] Univ Massachusetts, Div Vasc & Endo Vasc Surg, Sch Med, 55 Lake Ave, Amherst, MA 01655 USA; [Oderich, Gustavo S.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr, Div Vasc & Endo Vasc Surg, Houston, TX USA",,"Schanzer, A (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Div Vasc & Endo Vasc Surg, Sch Med, 55 Lake Ave, Amherst, MA 01655 USA.",andres.schanzer@umassmemorial.org,,,,,,,55,2,2,5,9,MASSACHUSETTS MEDICAL SOC,WALTHAM,"WALTHAM WOODS CENTER, 860 WINTER ST,, WALTHAM, MA 02451-1413 USA",0028-4793,1533-4406,,NEW ENGL J MED,N.

On the basis of data from 169 countries that include 98.4% of the world's births, we estimate that 29.7 million (21.1%, 95% uncertainty interval 19.9-22.4) births occurred through CS in 2015, which was almost double the number of births by this method in 2000 (16.0 million [12.1%, 10.9-13.3] births). CS use in 2015 was up to ten times more frequent in the Latin America and Caribbean region, where it was used in 44.3% (41.3-47.4) of births, than in the west and central Africa region, where it was used in 4.1% (3.6-4.6) of births. The global and regional increases in CS use were driven both by an increasing proportion of births occurring in health facilities (accounting for 66.5% of the global increase) and increases in CS use within health facilities (33.5%), with considerable variation between regions. Based on the most recent data available for each country, 15% of births in 106 (63%) of 169 countries were by CS, whereas 47 (28%) countries showed CS use in less than 10% of births. National CS use varied from 0.6% in South Sudan to 58.1% in the Dominican Republic. Within-country disparities in CS use were also very large: CS use was almost five times more frequent in births in the richest versus the poorest quintiles in low-income and middle-income countries; markedly high CS use was observed among low obstetric risk births, especially among more educated women in, for example, Brazil and China; and CS use was 1.6 times more frequent in private facilities than in public facilities.","[Boerma, Ties; Melesse, Dessalegn Y.] Univ Manitoba, Max Rady Coll Med, Rady Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3E 0W3, Canada; [Ronsmans, Carine] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London, England; [Barros, Aluisio J.

The specific references to mental health and substance use as targets within the health SDG reflect this transformative vision. In 2007, a series of papers in The Lancet synthesised decades of inter-disciplinary research and practice in diverse contexts and called the global community to action to scale up services for people affected by mental disorders (including sub-stance use disorders, self-harm, and dementia), in particular in low-income and middle-income countries in which the attainment of human rights to care and dignity were most seriously compromised. 10 years on, this Commission re-assesses the global mental health agenda in the context of the SDGs. Despite substantial research advances showing what can be done to prevent and treat mental disorders and to promote mental health, translation into real-world effects has been painfully slow. The global burden of disease attributable to mental disorders has risen in all countries in the context of major demographic, environmental, and sociopolitical transitions. Human rights violations and abuses persist in many countries, with large numbers of people locked away in mental institutions or prisons, or living on the streets, often without legal protection. The quality of mental health services is routinely worse than the quality of those for physical health. Government investment and development assistance for mental health remain pitifully small. Collective failure to respond to this global health crisis results in monumental loss of human capabilities and avoidable suffering.","[Patel, Vikram] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA USA; [Patel, Vikram; Saxena, Shekhar] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA USA; [Patel, Vikram] Sangath, Bardez, Goa, India; [Patel, Vikram; Sarkar, Bidyut K.] Publ Hlth Fdn India, New Delhi, India; [Lund, Crick] Kings Coll London, Ctr Global Mental Hlth, Hlth Serv & Populat Res Dept, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, London, England; [Lund, Crick] Univ Cape Town, Dept Psychiat & Mental Hlth, Alan J Flisher Ctr Publ Mental Hlth, Cape Town, South Africa; [Thornicroft, Graham; Jordans, Mark J.

Migraine is the second leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide. ObservationsPrimary headache disorders are defined as headaches that are unrelated to an underlying medical condition and are categorized into 4 groups: migraine, tension-type headache, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, and other primary headache disorders. Studies evaluating prevalence in more than 100000 people reported that tension-type headache affected 38% of the population, while migraine affected 12% and was the most disabling. Secondary headache disorders are defined as headaches due to an underlying medical condition and are classified according to whether they are due to vascular, neoplastic, infectious, or intracranial pressure/volume causes. Patients presenting with headache should be evaluated to determine whether their headache is most likely a primary or a secondary headache disorder. They should be evaluated for symptoms or signs that suggest an urgent medical problem such as an abrupt onset, neurologic signs, age 50 years and older, presence of cancer or immunosuppression, and provocation by physical activities or postural changes. Acute migraine treatment includes acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and combination products that include caffeine. Patients not responsive to these treatments may require migraine-specific treatments including triptans (5-HT1B/D agonists), which eliminate pain in 20% to 30% of patients by 2 hours, but are accompanied by adverse effects such as transient flushing, tightness, or tingling in the upper body in 25% of patients. Patients with or at high risk for cardiovascular disease should avoid triptans because of vasoconstrictive properties. Acute treatments with gepants, antagonists to receptors for the inflammatory neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide, such as rimegepant or ubrogepant, can eliminate headache symptoms for 2 hours in 20% of patients but have adverse effects of nausea and dry mouth in 1% to 4% of patients. A 5-HT1F agonist, lasmiditan, is also available for acute migraine treatment and appears safe in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Preventive treatments include antihypertensives, antiepileptics, antidepressants, calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibodies, and onabotulinumtoxinA, which reduce migraine by 1 to 3 days per month relative to placebo. Conclusions and RelevanceHeadache disorders affect approximately 90% of people during their lifetime. Among primary headache disorders, migraine is most debilitating and can be treated acutely with analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, triptans, gepants, and lasmiditan. This narrative review summarizes the clinical characteristics, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and acute and preventive treatment options for primary headache disorders (migraine, tension-type headache, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias) and secondary causes.","[Robbins, Matthew S.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Neurol, New York, NY USA",,"Robbins, MS (corresponding author), Weill Cornell Med, 520 E 70th St,Starr Pavil 607, New York, NY 10021 USA.",mar9391@med.cornell.edu,,,,,,,93,18,20,4,10,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

The median age of death from prostate cancer is 80 years. Many men with prostate cancer never experience symptoms and, without screening, would never know they have the disease. African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer have an increased risk of prostate cancer compared with other men. OBJECTIVE To update the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening for prostate cancer. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer and subsequent treatment of screen-detected prostate cancer. The USPSTF also commissioned a review of existing decision analysis models and the over diagnosis rate of PSA-based screening. The reviews also examined the benefits and harms of PSA-based screening in patient subpopulations at higher risk of prostate cancer, including older men, African American men, and men with a family history of prostate cancer. FINDINGS Adequate evidence from randomized clinical trials shows that PSA-based screening programs in men aged 55 to 69 years may prevent approximately 1.3 deaths from prostate cancer over approximately 13 years per 1000 men screened. Screening programs may also prevent approximately 3 cases of metastatic prostate cancer per 1000 men screened. Potential harms of screening include frequent false-positive results and psychological harms. Harms of prostate cancer treatment include erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and bowel symptoms. About 1 in 5 men who undergo radical prostatectomy develop long-term urinary incontinence, and 2 in 3 men will experience long-term erectile dysfunction. Adequate evidence shows that the harms of screening in men older than 70 years are at least moderate and greater than in younger men because of increased risk of false-positive results, diagnostic harms from biopsies, and harms from treatment. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men aged 55 to 69 years is small for some men. How each man weighs specific benefits and harms will determine whether the overall net benefit is small. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the potential benefits of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men 70 years and older do not outweigh the expected harms. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION For men aged 55 to 69 years, the decision to undergo periodic PSA-based screening for prostate cancer should be an individual one and should include discussion of the potential benefits and harms of screening with their clinician. Screening offers a small potential benefit of reducing the chance of death from prostate cancer in some men. However, many men will experience potential harms of screening, including false-positive results that require additional testing and possible prostate biopsy; overdiagnosis and overtreatment; and treatment complications, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction. In determining whether this service is appropriate in individual cases, patients and clinicians should consider the balance of benefits and harms on the basis of family history, race/ethnicity, comorbid medical conditions, patient values about the benefits and harms of screening and treatment-specific outcomes, and other health needs.

Until the last decade, the 5-year overall survival rate for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer was less than 5%. Improved understanding of the biology of lung cancer has resulted in the development of new biomarker-targeted therapies and led to improvements in overall survival for patients with advanced or metastatic disease. OBSERVATIONS Systemic therapy for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer is selected according to the presence of specific biomarkers. Therefore, all patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer should undergo molecular testing for relevant mutations and expression of the protein PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1). Molecular alterations that predict response to treatment (eg, EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangements, ROS1 rearrangements, and BRAF V600E mutations) are present in approximately 30% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Targeted therapy for these alterations improves progression-free survival compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy. For example, somatic activating mutations in the EGFR gene are present in approximately 20% of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib improve progression-free survival in patients with susceptible EGFR mutations. In patients with overexpression of ALK protein, the response rate was significantly better with crizotinib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) than with the combination of pemetrexed and either cisplatin or carboplatin (platinum-based chemotherapy) (74% vs 45%, respectively; P < .001) and progression-free survival (median, 10.9 months vs 7.0 months; P < .001). Subsequent generations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors have improved these agents. For patients without biomarkers indicating susceptibility to specific targeted treatments, immune checkpoint inhibitor-containing regimens either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy are superior vs chemotherapy alone. These advances in biomarker-directed therapy have led to improvements in overall survival. For example, the 5-year overall survival rate currently exceeds 25% among patients whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression (tumor proportion score of >= 50%) and 40% among patients with ALK-positive tumors. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Improved understanding of the biology and molecular subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer have led to more biomarker-directed therapies for patients with metastatic disease. These biomarker-directed therapies and newer empirical treatment regimens have improved overall survival for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.","[Arbour, Kathryn C.; Riely, Gregory J.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Thorac Oncol Serv,Div Solid Tumor, New York, NY USA",,"Riely, GJ (corresponding author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",rielyg@mskcc.org,"Riely, Gregory/AAF-4300-2019",,National Cancer Institute [P30 CA008748]; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE [P30CA008748] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,National Cancer Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)),This work was partially supported by grant P30 CA008748 from the National Cancer Institute awarded to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.,,84,396,412,24,140,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Comprehensive epidemiological data on HIV and antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage are scarce, particularly among transgender women. Sustained coverage of treatment is markedly uneven and challenged by lack of progress on stigma and criminalisation, and sustained human rights violations. Although important progress has been made in biomedical interventions with pre-exposure prophylaxis and early ART feasibility and demonstration projects, limited coverage and retention suggest that sustained investment in community and structural interventions is required for sex workers to benefit from the preventive interventions and treatments that other key populations have. Evidence-based progress on full decriminalisation grounded in health and human rights-a key recommendation in our Lancet Series-has stalled, with South Africa a notable exception. Additionally, several countries have rolled back rights to sex workers further. Removal of legal barriers through the decriminalisation of sex work, alongside political and funding investments to support community and structural interventions, is urgently needed to reverse the HIV trajectory and ensure health and human rights for all sex workers.","[Shannon, Kate] Univ British Columbia, Gender & Sexual Hlth Initiat, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1Y6, Canada; [Crago, Anna-Louise] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Baral, Stefan D.; Kerrigan, Deanna; Decker, Michele R.; Poteat, Tonia; Wirtz, Andrea L.; Weir, Brian; Beyrer, Chris] Johns Hopkins Univ, Ctr Publ Hlth & Human Rights, Baltimore, MD USA; [Bekker, Linda-Gail] Univ Cape Town, Desmond Tutu HIV Res Ctr, Cape Town, South Africa; [Boily, Marie-Claude] Imperial Coll, London, England; [Butler, Jenny] UN Populat Fund, Bangkok, Thailand; [Strathdee, Steffanie A.] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",,"Shannon, K (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Gender & Sexual Hlth Initiat, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1Y6, Canada.",kate.shannon@ubc.ca,"Baral, Stefan/AAG-4818-2020; Strathdee, Steffanie A/B-9042-2009; Bekker, Linda-Gail/AAZ-8929-2020","Baral, Stefan/0000-0002-5482-2419; Poteat, Tonia/0000-0001-6541-3787; Strathdee, Steffanie/0000-0002-7724-691X; BEKKER, LINDA-GAIL/0000-0002-0755-4386; Weir, Brian/0000-0003-1634-218X; Decker, Michele/0000-0002-7085-7080; Boily, Marie-Claude/0000-0003-3919-006X","Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; UN Population Fund; US Agency for International Development (USAID); Canada Research Chair in Global Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS; US National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01DA028648-09]; HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) modelling centre; NIH [UM1 AIO68617, P30AI094189]; Supporting Operational AIDS Research [AID-OAA-140060]; President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief; USAID; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES [UM1AI068617, P30AI094189] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE [R01DA031074, R01DA028648] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; MRC [MR/R015600/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationCGIAR); UN Population Fund; US Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Canada Research Chair in Global Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS; US National Institutes of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) modelling centre; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Supporting Operational AIDS Research; President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USA); USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"The 2014 Lancet Series on HIV and sex work was supported by grants to the Center for Public Health and Human Rights at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH) from The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the UN Population Fund.

Appropriate screening, diagnosis, and management by primary care clinicians are necessary to prevent adverse CKD-associated outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, end-stage kidney disease, and death. OBSERVATIONS Defined as a persistent abnormality in kidney structure or function (eg, glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or albuminuria >= 30 mg per 24 hours) for more than 3 months, CKD affects 8% to 16% of the population worldwide. In developed countries, CKD is most commonly attributed to diabetes and hypertension. However, less than 5% of patients with early CKD report awareness of their disease. Among individuals diagnosed as having CKD, staging and new risk assessment tools that incorporate GFR and albuminuria can help guide treatment, monitoring, and referral strategies. Optimal management of CKD includes cardiovascular risk reduction (eg, statins and blood pressure management), treatment of albuminuria (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers), avoidance of potential nephrotoxins (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and adjustments to drug dosing (eg, many antibiotics and oral hypoglycemic agents). Patients also require monitoring for complications of CKD, such as hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, vitamin D deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and anemia. Those at high risk of CKD progression (eg, estimated GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), albuminuria >= 300 mg per 24 hours, or rapid decline in estimated GFR) should be promptly referred to a nephrologist. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Diagnosis, staging, and appropriate referral of CKD by primary care clinicians are important in reducing the burden of CKD worldwide.","[Chen, Teresa K.; Knicely, Daphne H.; Grams, Morgan E.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Nephrol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Chen, Teresa K.; Grams, Morgan E.] Johns Hopkins Med Inst, Wekh Ctr Prevent Epidemiol & Clin Res, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA",,"Grams, ME (corresponding author), 2024 E Monument St, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA.",mgrams2@jhmi.edu,,,"Clinician Scientist Career Development Award from Johns Hopkins University; George M.

Feminist theory has the potential to move clinicians and educators from theory to action, building bridges of solidarity between the medical profession and the community it is called to serve.","[Sharma, Malika] Casey House, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Sharma, Malika] Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Womens Coll Hosp, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Sharma, Malika] Maple Leaf Med Clin, 14 Coll St, Toronto, ON M5G 1K2, Canada",,"Sharma, M (corresponding author), Maple Leaf Med Clin, 14 Coll St, Toronto, ON M5G 1K2, Canada.",malika.sharma@mail.utoronto.ca,,,Department of Medicine Clinician Educator Training Program at the University of Toronto,Department of Medicine Clinician Educator Training Program at the University of Toronto,This project was funded through the Department of Medicine Clinician Educator Training Program at the University of Toronto.,,97,33,35,7,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,FEB 9,2019,393,10171,,,,,570,578,,10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32595-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32595-9,,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),General & Internal Medicine,HK7QO,30739692,Bronze,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000458184300038,View Full Record in Web of Science,47233,0,34,76,79,93,60,67,41,40,31,66,22,9,51,6,14

In this Series paper, we explore how to address all three through recognition and then with disruptive solutions. We used intersectional feminist theory to guide our systematic reviews, qualitative case studies based on lived experiences, and quantitative analyses based on cross- sectional and evaluation research. We found that health systems reinforce patients' traditional gender roles and neglect gender inequalities in health, health system models and clinic- based programmes are rarely gender responsive, and women have less authority as health workers than men and are often devalued and abused. With regard to potential for disruption, we found that gender equality policies are associated with greater representation of female physicians, which in turn is associated with better health outcomes, but that gender parity is insufficient to achieve gender equality. We found that institutional support and respect of nurses improves quality of care, and that women's empowerment collectives can increase health- care access and provider responsiveness. We see promise from social movements in supporting women's reproductive rights and policies. Our findings suggest we must view gender as a fundamental factor that predetermines and shapes health systems and outcomes. Without addressing the role of restrictive gender norms and gender inequalities within and outside health systems, we will not reach our collective ambitions of universal health coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals. We propose action to systematically identify and address restrictive gender norms and gender inequalities in health systems.","[Hay, Katherine; Atmavilas, Yamini] Bill & Melinda Gates Fdn, Seattle, WA USA; [McDougal, Lotus; Fielding-Miller, Rebecca; Yore, Jennifer; Bhan, Nandita; Silverman, Jay G.; Raj, Anita; Raj, Anita] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Med, Ctr Gender Equ & Hlth, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Percival, Valerie] Carleton Univ, Norman Paterson Sch Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Henry, Sarah] Stanford Univ, Dept Pediat, Sch Med, Stanford, CA USA; [Klugman, Jeni] Georgetown Univ, Georgetown Inst Women Peace & Secur, Washington, DC USA; [Klugman, Jeni] Harvard Kennedy Sch, Women & Publ Policy Program, Cambridge, MA USA; [Wurie, Haja] Univ Sierra Leone, Coll Med & Allied Hlth Sci, Freetown, Sierra Leone; [Raven, Joanna] Univ Liverpool Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Dey, Arnab; Dehingia, Nabamallika] Sambodhi Res & Commun, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Morgan, Rosemary] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Saggurti, Niranjan; Mahapatra, Bidhubhusan; Hazra, Avishek; Mozumdar, Arupendra] Populat Council, Delhi, India; [Blokhina, Elena] First Pavlov State Med Univ St Petersburg, Vladman Inst Pharmacol, Dept Psychiat, St Petersburg, Russia; [Huque, Rumana] ARK Fdn, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Barasa, Edwine] Kemri Wellcome Trust, Kenya Res Programme, Nairobi, Kenya; [Kharel, Chandani; Baral, Sushil] HERD Int, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Envarli, Kristen] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wyss, Natalie; Blair, Scott; Shakya, Holly] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Levy, Jessica] Washington St Louis Univ, St Louis, MO USA; [Chandurkar, Dharmendra; Singh, Kultar] Sambodhi Res, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Krishnan, Suneeta] Gates Fdn, New Delhi, India; [Waldman, Linda] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England; [Muraya, Kui] Kemri Wellcome Trust, Nairobi, Kenya; [Cartwright, Chris; Elsey, Helen; King, Rebecca] Univ Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",,"Raj, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Med, Ctr Gender Equ & Hlth, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",anitaraj@ucsd.edu,"Elsey, Helen/AAZ-1121-2020; Heise, LORI/AAI-6251-2020; Hay, Katherine/ABB-7795-2021; Fielding-Miller, Rebecca/AAE-7787-2020; Hawkes, Sarah/AAK-7375-2020; Blokhina, Elena A/V-6040-2018; Dehingia, Nabamallika/AAY-5588-2021; Darmstadt, Gary/AAU-7488-2020; Dehingia, Nabamallika/AAF-1639-2021","Elsey, Helen/0000-0003-4724-0581; Fielding-Miller, Rebecca/0000-0002-5099-0589; Blokhina, Elena A/0000-0001-5811-9897; Dehingia, Nabamallika/0000-0003-1787-9050; Raven, Joanna/0000-0002-4112-6959; Shabalala, Fortunate/0000-0003-3019-4865; Darmstadt, Gary/0000-0002-7522-5824; Morgan, Rosemary/0000-0001-5009-8470; Saggurti, Niranjan/0000-0002-5267-8425; Heymann, Jody/0000-0003-0008-4198; Wurie, Haja Ramatulai/0000-0002-2500-3393; Dey, Arnab K./0000-0003-4585-3130; Barasa, Edwine/0000-0001-5793-7177",Gates Foundation; United Arab Emirates Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH [K01MH112436] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); United Arab Emirates Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)),"The work of the Series was funded by the Gender Equality, Integrated Delivery, HIV, Nutrition, Family Planning, and Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene programme strategy teams at the Gates Foundation and the United Arab Emirates Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation through grants to Stanford University.

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) previously found strong evidence that prenatal HIV screening reduced risk of mother-to-child transmission. The previous evidence review was conducted in 2012. OBJECTIVE To update the 2012 review on prenatal HIV screening to inform the USPSTF. DATA SOURCES Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2012 to June 2018, with surveillance through January 2019. STUDY SELECTION Pregnant persons 13 years and older; randomized clinical trials and cohort studies of screening vs no screening; risk of mother-to-child transmission or maternal or infant harms associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy; screening yield at different intervals or in different risk groups. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS One investigator abstracted data; a second checked accuracy. Two investigators independently rated study quality. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mother-to-child transmission; harms of screening and treatment; screening yield. RESULTS Sixty-two studies were included in this review, including 29 new studies. There remains no direct evidence on effects of prenatal screening vs no screening on risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission, maternal or infant clinical outcomes, or the yield of repeat or alternative screening strategies. New evidence confirms that combination ART is highly effective at reducing the risk of mother-to-child transmission, with some new cohort studies reporting rates of mother-to-child transmission less than 1% when combination ART was started early in pregnancy (when begun in first trimester, 0%-0.4%; when begun after first trimester, or at any time if timing of ART initiation not reported, 0.4%-2.8%). New evidence on harms of ART was also largely consistent with the previous review. Evidence from primarily observational studies found prenatal combination ART with a boosted protease inhibitor associated with increased risk of preterm delivery (range, 14.4%-26.1%). For other birth outcomes (low birth weight, small for gestational age, stillbirth, birth defects, neonatal death), results were mixed and depended on the specific antiretroviral drug or drug regimen given and timing of prenatal therapy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Combination ART was highly effective at reducing risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission. Use of certain ART regimens during pregnancy was associated with increased risk of harms that may be mitigated by selection of ART regimen. The 2012 review found that avoidance of breastfeeding and cesarean delivery in women with viremia also reduced risk of transmission and that prenatal screening accurately diagnosed HIV infection.","[Selph, Shelley S.; Bougatsos, Christina; Dana, Tracy; Grusing, Sara; Chou, Roger] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Med Informat & Clin Epidemiol, Pacific Northwest Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Selph, Shelley S.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Family Med, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Chou, Roger] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Div Gen Internal Med & Geriatr, Portland, OR 97239 USA",,"Selph, SS (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd,Mail Code BICC, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",selphs@ohsu.edu,,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA290201500009i]; USPSTF","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services; USPSTF","This research was funded under contract HHSA290201500009i, Task Order 7, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the USPSTF.",,78,11,11,0,4,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Increased awareness of the condition resulting from ongoing campaigns and the evidence arising from research in the past 10 years have increased understanding of this problem among clinicians and lay people, and have led to improved outcomes. The World Health Assembly and WHO made sepsis a global health priority in 2017 and have adopted a resolution to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and management of sepsis. In 2016, a new definition of sepsis (Sepsis-3) was developed. Sepsis is now defined as infection with organ dysfunction. This definition codifies organ dysfunction using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Ongoing research aims to improve definition of patient populations to allow for individualised management strategies matched to a patient's molecular and biochemical profile. The search continues for improved diagnostic techniques that can facilitate this aim, and for a pharmacological agent that can improve outcomes by modifying the disease process.

The SSN is consistently rated within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development among the highest countries for life expectancy and among the lowest in health-care spending as a proportion of gross domestic product. Italy appears to be in an envious position. However, a rapidly ageing population, increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, rising demand, and the COVID-19 pandemic have exposed weaknesses in the system. These weaknesses are linked to the often tumultuous history of the nation and the health-care system, in which innovation and initiative often lead to spiralling costs and difficulties, followed by austere cost-containment measures. We describe how the tenuous balance of centralised versus regional control has shifted over time to create not one, but 20 different health systems, exacerbating differences in access to care across regions. We explore how Italy can rise to the challenges ahead, providing recommendations for systemic change, with emphasis on data-driven planning, prevention, and research; integrated care and technology; and investments in personnel. The evolution of the SSN is characterised by an ongoing struggle to balance centralisation and decentralisation in a health-care system, a dilemma faced by many nations. If in times of emergency, planning, coordination, and control by the central government can guarantee uniformity of provider behaviour and access to care, during non-emergency times, we believe that a balance can be found provided that autonomy is paired with accountability in achieving certain objectives, and that the central government develops the skills and, therefore, the legitimacy, to formulate health policies of a national nature. These processes would provide local governments with the strategic means to develop local plans and programmes, and the knowledge and tools to coordinate local initiatives for eventual transfer to the larger system.","[Ricciardi, Walter] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy; [Tarricone, Rosanna] Bocconi Univ, Dept Social & Polit Sci, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Tarricone, Rosanna] SDA Bocconi Sch Management, Ctr Res Hlth & Social Care Management, Milan, Italy",,"Tarricone, R (corresponding author), Bocconi Univ, Dept Social & Polit Sci, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",rosanna.tarricone@unibocconi.it,,"TARRICONE, ROSANNA/0000-0002-2009-9357",,,,,72,3,3,3,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,DEC 11,2021,398,10317,,,,,2193,2206,,10.1016/S0140-6736(21)01733-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)01733-5,,DEC 2021,14,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),General & Internal Medicine,XN4HM,34695372,,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000729467800001,View Full Record in Web of Science,47550,0,55,61,46,57,65,33,18,8,49,57,14,24,2,64,14
J,"Taylor, HS; Kotlyar, AM; Flores, VA",,,,"Taylor, Hugh S.; Kotlyar, Alexander M.; Flores, Valerie A.",,,Endometriosis is a chronic systemic disease: clinical challenge and novel innovations,LANCET,,,English,Review,,,,,,,,"Endometriosis is a common disease affecting 5-10% of women of reproductive age globally. However, despite its prevalence, diagnosis is typically delayed by years, misdiagnosis is common, and delivery of effective therapy is prolonged. Identification and prompt treatment of endometriosis are essential and facilitated by accurate clinical diagnosis. Endometriosis is classically defined as a chronic, gynaecological disease characterised by endometrial-like tissue present outside of the uterus and is thought to arise by retrograde menstruation. However, this description is outdated and no longer reflects the true scope and manifestations of the disease. The clinical presentation is varied, the presence of pelvic lesions is heterogeneous, and the manifestations of the disease outside of the female reproductive tract remain poorly understood. Endometriosis is now considered a systemic disease rather than a disease predominantly affecting the pelvis. Endometriosis affects metabolism in liver and adipose tissue, leads to systemic inflammation, and alters gene expression in the brain that causes pain sensitisation and mood disorders. The full effect of the disease is not fully recognised and goes far beyond the pelvis. Recognition of the full scope of the disease will facilitate clinical diagnosis and allow for more comprehensive treatment than currently available. Progestins and low-dose oral contraceptives are unsuccessful in a third of symptomatic women globally, probably as a result of progesterone resistance. Oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists constitute an effective and tolerable therapeutic alternative when first-line medications do not work. The development of GnRH antagonists has resulted in oral drugs that have fewer side-effects than other therapies and has allowed for rapid movement between treatments to optimise and personalise endometriosis care. In this Review, we discuss the latest understanding of endometriosis as a systemic disease with multiple manifestations outside the parameters of classic gynaecological disease.","[Taylor, Hugh S.; Kotlyar, Alexander M.; Flores, Valerie A.] Yale Sch Med, Dept Obstet Gynecol & Reprod Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",,"Taylor, HS (corresponding author), Yale Sch Med, Dept Obstet Gynecol & Reprod Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",hugh.taylor@yale.edu,,,,,,,229,51,57,16,32,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,FEB 27,2021,397,10276,,,,,839,852,,,,,,14,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,QP6DN,33640070,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000623925500034,View Full Record in Web of Science,47909,0,144,98,53,165,168,90,145,20,182,46,68,87,84,151,222

Laser refractive surgery procedures (such as laser in-situ keratomileusis), surface ablation techniques (such as laser epithelial keratomileusis), and photorefractive keratectomy have now been established as fairly safe procedures that produce excellent visual outcomes for patients with low-to-moderate amounts of ametropia. Additionally, a broader selection of options are now available to treat a wider range of refractive errors. Small incision lenticule extraction uses a femtosecond laser to shape a refractive lenticule, which is removed through a small wound. The potential advantages of this procedure include greater tectonic strength and less dry eye. In the future, intracorneal implants could be used to treat hyperopia or presbyopia. Phakic intraocular implants and refractive lens exchange might be useful options in carefully selected patients for correcting high degrees of ametropia. Thus, physicians are now able to provide patients with the appropriate refractive corrective option based on the individual's risk-benefit profile.","[Kim, Tae-im] Yonsei Univ, Dept Ophthalmol, Inst Vis Res, Coll Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Alio del Barrio, Jorge L.] Res & Dev Dept VISSUM Innovat Alicante, Cornea Cataract & Refract Surg Unit, Alicante, Spain; [Alio del Barrio, Jorge L.] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Div Ophthalmol, Sch Med, Alicante, Spain; [Wilkins, Mark] Moorfields Eye Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, London, England; [Cochener, Beatrice] Univ Hosp Morvan, Dept Ophthalmol, Brest, France; [Ang, Marcus] Singapore Natl Eye Ctr, Singapore Eye Res Inst, Singapore, Singapore; [Ang, Marcus] Duke NUS Grad Med Sch, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Singapore, Singapore",,"Ang, M (corresponding author), Singapore Natl Eye Ctr, 11 Third Hosp Ave, Singapore 168751, Singapore.",marcus.ang@snec.com.sg,"; Wilkins, Mark/N-1452-2015","Alio del Barrio, Jorge/0000-0003-2666-3366; Kim, Tae-im/0000-0001-6414-3842; Wilkins, Mark/0000-0002-8742-9162",,,,,154,77,83,9,33,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,MAY 18,2019,393,10185,,,,,2085,2098,,10.1016/S0140-6736(18)33209-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)33209-4,,,14,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,HY4QC,31106754,,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000468112000031,View Full Record in Web of Science,47935,0,133,114,22,16,44,113,93,38,115,64,11,104,138,3,58

Malignant primary brain tumours remain among the most difficult cancers to treat, with a 5 year overall survival no greater than 35%. The most common malignant primary brain tumours in adults are gliomas. Recent advances in molecular biology have improved understanding of glioma pathogenesis, and several clinically significant genetic alterations have been described. A number of these (IDH, 1p/19q codeletion, H3 Lys27Met, and RELA-fusion) are now combined with histology in the revised 2016 WHO classification of CNS tumours. It is likely that understanding such molecular alterations will contribute to the diagnosis, grading, and treatment of brain tumours. This progress in genomics, along with significant advances in cancer and CNS immunology, has defined a new era in neuro-oncology and holds promise for diagntic and therapeutic improvement. The challenge at present is to translate these advances into effective treatments. Current efforts are focused on developing molecular targeted therapies, immunotherapies, gene therapies, and novel drug-delivery technologies. Results with single-agent therapies have been disappointing so far, and combination therapies seem to be required to achieve a broad and durable antitumour response. Biomarker-targeted clinical trials could improve efficiencies of therapeutic development.","[Lapointe, Sarah; Butowski, Nicholas A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol Surg, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Perry, Arie] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Pathol, San Francisco, CA 94140 USA",,"Butowski, NA (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol Surg, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",nicholas.butowski@ucsf.edu,,,BMS; Beigene; Celldex; Deciphera; Delmar; EpicentRx; Five Prime; Kadmon; Eli Lilly; Medicenna; Istari; Orbus; Tocagen; VBL; Arbor,BMS(Bristol-Myers Squibb); Beigene; Celldex; Deciphera; Delmar; EpicentRx; Five Prime; Kadmon; Eli Lilly(Eli Lilly); Medicenna; Istari; Orbus; Tocagen; VBL; Arbor,"NAB has research funding from the following industry partners: BMS, Beigene, Celldex, Deciphera, Delmar, EpicentRx, Five Prime, Kadmon, Eli Lilly, Medicenna, Istari, Orbus, Tocagen, VBL, Arbor.

OBJECTIVE To systematically review evidence on prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based prostate cancer screening, treatments for localized prostate cancer, and prebiopsy risk calculators to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force. DATA SOURCES Searches of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Registries and Databases from July 1, 2011, through July 15, 2017, with a surveillance search on February 1, 2018. STUDY SELECTION English-language reports of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of screening; cohort studies reporting harms; RCTs and cohort studies of active localized cancer treatments vs conservative approaches (eg, active surveillance, watchful waiting); external validations of prebiopsy risk calculators to identify aggressive cancers. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS One investigator abstracted data; a second checked accuracy. Two investigators independently rated study quality. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prostate cancer and all-cause mortality; false-positive screening results, biopsy complications, overdiagnosis; adverse effects of active treatments. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for treatment harms. RESULTS Sixty-three studies in 104 publications were included (N = 1 904 950). Randomization to PSA screening was not associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer mortality in either a US trial with substantial control group contamination (n = 76 683) or a UK trial with low adherence to a single PSA screen (n = 408 825) but was associated with significantly reduced prostate cancer mortality in a European trial (n = 162 243; relative risk [RR], 0.79 [95% CI, 0.69-0.91]; absolute risk reduction, 1.1 deaths per 10 000 person-years [95% CI, 0.5-1.8]). Of 61 604 men screened in the European trial, 17.8% received false-positive results. In 3 cohorts (n = 15 136), complications requiring hospitalization occurred in 0.5% to 1.6% of men undergoing biopsy after abnormal screening findings. Overdiagnosis was estimated to occur in 20.7% to 50.4% of screen-detected cancers. In an RCT of men with screen-detected prostate cancer (n = 1643), neither radical prostatectomy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63 [95% CI, 0.21-1.93]) nor radiation therapy (HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.15-1.69]) were associated with significantly reduced prostate cancer mortality vs active monitoring, although each was associated with significantly lower risk of metastatic disease. Relative to conservative management, radical prostatectomy was associated with increased risk of urinary incontinence (pooled RR, 2.27 [95% CI, 1.82-2.84]; 3 trials; n = 1796) and erectile dysfunction (pooled RR, 1.82 [95% CI, 1.62-2.04]; 2 trials; n = 883). Relative to conservative management (8 cohort studies; n = 3066), radiation therapy was associated with increased risk of erectile dysfunction (pooled RR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.20-1.42]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE PSA screening may reduce prostate cancer mortality risk but is associated with false-positive results, biopsy complications, and overdiagnosis. Compared with conservative approaches, active treatments for screen-detected prostate cancer have unclear effects on long-term survival but are associated with sexual and urinary difficulties.","[Fenton, Joshua J.; Weyrich, Meghan S.; Durbin, Shauna; Melnikow, Joy] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Healthcare Policy & Res, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA; [Fenton, Joshua J.; Melnikow, Joy] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Family & Community Med, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA; [Liu, Yu; Bang, Heejung] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Div Biostat, Davis, CA 95616 USA",,"Fenton, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Med Ctr, Dept Family & Community Med, 4860 Y St,Ste 2300, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA.",jjfenton@ucdavis.edu,"Fenton, Joshua/AAD-4114-2021","Fenton, Joshua/0000-0002-0581-835X","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA-290-2012-00015-I]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA-290-2012-00015-I, Task Order 6, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the USPSTF.",,107,221,226,5,33,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Although an ageing population and fewer benign hysterectomies have contributed to this trend, the growing prevalence of obesity is the major underlying cause. Obesity poses challenges for diagnosis and treatment and more research is needed to offer primary prevention to high-risk women and to optimise endometrial cancer survivorship. Early presentation with postmenopausal bleeding ensures most endometrial cancers are cured by hysterectomy but those with advanced disease have a poor prognosis. Minimally invasive surgical staging and sentinel-lymph-node biopsy provides a low morbidity alternative to historical surgical management without compromising oncological outcomes. Adjuvant radiotherapy reduces loco-regional recurrence in intermediate-risk and high-risk cases. Advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of endometrial cancer have paved the way for targeted chemotherapeutic strategies, and clinical trials will establish their benefit in adjuvant, advanced, and recurrent disease settings in the coming years.","[Crosbie, Emma J.; Kitson, Sarah J.] Univ Manchester, St Marys Hosp, Fac Biol Med & Hlth, Gynaecol Oncol Res Grp,Div Canc Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Crosbie, Emma J.] Manchester Univ NHS Fdn Trust, Manchester Acad Hlth Sci Ctr, St Marys Hosp, Dept Obstet & Gynaecol, Manchester, Lancs, England; [McAlpine, Jessica N.] Univ British Columbia, Div Gynecol Oncol, Dept Obstet & Gynaecol, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [McAlpine, Jessica N.] Univ British Columbia, BC Canc, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Mukhopadhyay, Asima] Chittaranjan Natl Canc Inst, Kolkata Gynecol Oncol Trials & Translat Res Grp, Kolkata, India; [Mukhopadhyay, Asima] James Cook Univ Hosp, Dept Gynaecol Oncol, Middlesbrough, Cleveland, England; [Mukhopadhyay, Asima] Newcastle Univ, Dept Gynaecol Oncol, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Powell, Melanie E.] Barts & London NHS Trust, Dept Clin Oncol, London, England; [Singh, Naveena] Vancouver Gen Hosp, Dept Anat Pathol, Vancouver, BC, Canada",,"Crosbie, EJ (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, St Marys Hosp, Fac Biol Med & Hlth, Div Canc Sci, Manchester M13 9WL, Lancs, England.",emma.crosbie@manchester.ac.uk,,"Kitson, Sarah/0000-0003-2763-7370",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [NIHR300650]; NIHR Manchester Biomedical Research Centre [IS-BRC-1215-20007]; Wellbeing of Women Postdoctoral Research Fellowship [PRF101],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)); NIHR Manchester Biomedical Research Centre(National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)); Wellbeing of Women Postdoctoral Research Fellowship,EJC is a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Advanced Fellow (NIHR300650) and her work is supported by the NIHR Manchester Biomedical Research Centre (IS-BRC-1215-20007).

A series of fundamental questions have been raised about AI-driven health interventions, and whether the tools, methods, and protections traditionally used to make ethical and evidence-based decisions about new technologies can be applied to AI. Deployment of AI has already begun for a broad range of health issues common to LMICs, with interventions focused primarily on communicable diseases, including tuberculosis and malaria. Types of AI vary, but most use some form of machine learning or signal processing. Several types of machine learning methods are frequently used together, as is machine learning with other approaches, most often signal processing. AI-driven health interventions fit into four categories relevant to global health researchers: (1) diagnosis, (2) patient morbidity or mortality risk assessment, (3) disease outbreak prediction and surveillance, and (4) health policy and planning. However, much of the AI-driven intervention research in global health does not describe ethical, regulatory, or practical considerations required for widespread use or deployment at scale. Despite the field remaining nascent, AI-driven health interventions could lead to improved health outcomes in LMICs.

Risk factors for developing pancreatic cancer include family history, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and tobacco use. Patients typically present with advanced disease due to lack of or vague symptoms when the cancer is still localised. High quality computed tomography with intravenous contrast using a dual phase pancreatic protocol is typically the best method to detect a pancreatic tumour and to determine surgical resectability. Endoscopic ultrasound is an increasingly used complementary staging modality which also allows for diagnostic confirmation when combined with fine needle aspiration. Patients with pancreatic cancer are often divided into one of four categories based on extent of disease: resectable, borderline resectable, locally advanced, and metastatic; patient condition is also an important consideration. Surgical resection represents the only chance for cure, and advancements in adjuvant chemotherapy have improved long-term outcomes in these patients. Systemic chemotherapy combinations including FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil, folinic acid [leucovorin], irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel remain the mainstay of treatment for patients with advanced disease. Data on the benefit of PARP inhibition as maintenance therapy in patients with germline BRCA1 or BRACA2 mutations might prove to be a harbinger of advancement in targeted therapy. Additional research efforts are focusing on modulating the pancreatic tumour microenvironment to enhance the efficacy of the immunotherapeutic strategies.","[Mizrahi, Jonathan D.; Surana, Rishi] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Div Canc Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Valle, Juan W.] Univ Manchester, Christie NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Med Oncol, Div Canc Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Shroff, Rachna T.] Univ Arizona, Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Div Hematol & Oncol, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA",,"Shroff, RT (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Div Hematol & Oncol, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA.",rshroff@arizona.edu,"Lobo, Dileep/AAC-6207-2020","Lobo, Dileep/0000-0003-1187-5796",,,,,122,472,492,76,188,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,JUN 27,2020,395,10242,,,,,2008,2020,,,,,,13,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,MJ0ZZ,32593337,,Y,Y,2022-07-11,WOS:000547825600018,View Full Record in Web of Science,48506,0,48,112,116,53,1,27,20,69,23,88,102,33,49,74,65

As the global community seeks to contend with even hotter weather in the future as a consequence of global climate change, there is a pressing need to better understand the most effective prevention and response measures that can be implemented, particularly in low-resource settings. In this Series paper, we describe how a future reliance on air conditioning is unsustainable and further marginalises the communities most vulnerable to the heat. We then show that a more holistic understanding of the thermal environment at the landscape and urban, building, and individual scales supports the identification of numerous sustainable opportunities to keep people cooler. We summarise the benefits (eg, effectiveness) and limitations of each identified cooling strategy, and recommend optimal interventions for settings such as aged care homes, slums, workplaces, mass gatherings, refugee camps, and playing sport. The integration of this information into well communicated heat action plans with robust surveillance and monitoring is essential for reducing the adverse health consequences of current and future extreme heat.","[Jay, Ollie; Morris, Nathan B.] Univ Sydney, Thermal Ergon Lab, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Jay, Ollie] Univ Sydney, Sydney Sch Hlth Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Jay, Ollie; Capon, Anthony] Univ Sydney, Sydney Sch Publ Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Jay, Ollie] Univ Sydney, Charles Perkins Ctr, Fac Med & Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [de Dear, Richard] Univ Sydney, Indoor Environm Qual Lab, Sch Architecture Design & Planning, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Malik, Arunima] Univ Sydney, Sch Phys, Fac Sci, ISA, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Malik, Arunima] Univ Sydney, Discipline Accounting, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Capon, Anthony] Monash Univ, Monash Sustainable Dev Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Berry, Peter] Univ Waterloo, Fac Environm, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Broderick, Carolyn] UNSW Med, Sch Med Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Broderick, Carolyn] Childrens Hosp Westmead, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Havenith, George] Loughborough Univ, Environm Ergon Res Ctr, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Honda, Yasushi] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Hlth & Sport Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Kovats, R.

OBJECTIVE To systematically review literature on the effectiveness and harms of screening for syphilis in pregnancy and the harms of penicillin treatment in pregnancy to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant English-language literature, published from January 1, 2008, to June 2, 2017. Ongoing surveillance was conducted through November 22, 2017. STUDY SELECTION Studies conducted in countries categorized as high or very high on the Human Development Index that explicitly addressed 1 of 3 a priori-defined key questions. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Independent critical appraisal and data abstraction by 2 reviewers. Data from included studies were narratively synthesized without pooling data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incidence of congenital syphilis; any harms of screening or penicillin treatment in pregnancy. RESULTS Seven studies in 8 publications were included. One observational study evaluated the implementation of syphilis screening in pregnancy in 2 441 237 women in China. From 2002 to 2012, screening for syphilis in all pregnant women increased from 89.8% to 97.2%, and the incidence of congenital syphilis decreased from 109.3 to 9.4 cases per 100 000 live births. Five studies (n = 21795) evaluated the false-positive findings of treponemal tests and 1 study (n = 318) evaluated the false-negative findings of nontreponemal tests. These studies found that false-positives with treponemal-specific enzyme or chemiluminescent immunoassays were common (46.5%-88.2%), therefore warranting reflexive (automatic confirmatory) testing for all positive test findings. One study (n = 318) found no false-negatives with treponemal tests, and 1 study (n = 139) demonstrated the prozone phenomenon (false-negative response from high antibody titer) with rapid plasma reagin screening using undiluted samples (2.9%). No studies were identified for harms of penicillin in pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women is associated with reduced incidence of congenital syphilis, and available evidence supports the need for reflexive testing for positive test results.","[Lin, Jennifer S.; Eder, Michelle L.; Bean, Sarah I.] Kaiser Permanente, Kaiser Permanente Res Affiliates Evidence Based P, Ctr Hlth Res, Portland, OR USA",,"Lin, JS (corresponding author), Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Kaiser Permanente Res Affiliates Evidence Based P, Ctr Hlth Res, 3800 N Interstate Ave, Portland, OR 97227 USA.",jennifer.s.lin@kpchr.org,,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA290201200015I, 5]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA290201200015I, Task Order 5, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the USPSTF.",,21,14,16,0,2,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

The introduction of immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors, and CD38-targeting antibodies has extended survival, but ultimately the majority of patients will die from their disease, and some from treatment-related complications. Disease progression and subsequent relapses are characterised by subclonal evolution and increasingly resistant disease. Patients with multiple myeloma usually have hypercalcaemia, renal failure, anaemia, or osteolytic bone lesions-and a detailed diagnostic investigation is needed to differentiate between symptomatic multiple myeloma that requires treatment, and precursor states. Risk stratification using both patient-specific (eg, performance status) and disease-specific (eg, presence of high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities) is important for prognosis and to define the best treatment strategy. Current research strategies include the use of minimal residual disease assays to guide therapy, refining immunotherapeutic approaches, and intercepting disease early in smouldering multiple myeloma.","[van de Donk, Niels W.

Multiple myeloma is diagnosed in an estimated 34 920 people in the US and in approximately 588 161 people worldwide each year. OBSERVATIONS Among patients with multiple myeloma, approximately 73% have anemia, 79% have osteolytic bone disease, and 19% have acute kidney injury at the time of presentation. Evaluation of patients with possible multiple myeloma includes measurement of hemoglobin, serum creatinine, serum calcium, and serum free light chain levels; serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation; 24-hour urine protein electrophoresis; and full-body skeletal imaging with computed tomography, positron emission tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging. The Revised International Staging System combines data from the serum biomarkers beta(2) microglobulin, albumin, and lactate dehydrogenase in conjunction with malignant plasma cell genomic features found on fluorescence in situ hybridization-t(4;14), del(17p), and t(14;16)-to assess estimated progression-free survival and overall survival. At diagnosis, 28% of patients are classified as having Revised International Staging stage I multiple myeloma, and these patients have a median 5-year survival of 82%. Among all patients with multiple myeloma, standard first-line (induction) therapy consists of a combination of an injectable proteasome inhibitor (ie, bortezomib), an oral immunomodulatory agent (ie, lenalidomide), and dexamethasone and is associated with median progression-free survival of 41 months, compared with historical reports of 8.5 months without therapy. This induction therapy combined with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation followed by maintenance lenalidomide is standard of care for eligible patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Approximately 34 920 people in the US and 155 688 people worldwide are diagnosed with multiple myeloma each year. Induction therapy with an injectable proteasome inhibitor, an oral immunomodulatory agent and dexamethasone followed by treatment with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and maintenance therapy with lenalidomide are among the treatments considered standard care for eligible patients.","[Cowan, Andrew J.; Green, Damian J.; Lee, Sarah; Holmberg, Leona A.; Gopal, Ajay K.; Libby, Edward N.] Univ Washington, Dept Med, Div Med Oncol, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Cowan, Andrew J.; Green, Damian J.; Lee, Sarah; Holmberg, Leona A.; Tuazon, Sherilyn; Gopal, Ajay K.; Libby, Edward N.] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Div Clin Res, 1124 Columbia St, Seattle, WA 98104 USA; [Cowan, Andrew J.; Green, Damian J.; Kwok, Mary; Lee, Sarah; Holmberg, Leona A.; Gopal, Ajay K.; Libby, Edward N.] Seattle Canc Care Alliance, Seattle, WA USA; [Kwok, Mary] Univ Washington, Dept Med, Div Hematol, Seattle, WA USA; [Coffey, David G.] Univ Miami Hlth Syst, Sylvester Comprehens Canc Ctr, Miami, FL USA; [Tuazon, Sherilyn] Bristol Myers Squibb, Seattle, WA USA",,"Libby, EN (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Div Med Oncol, Dept Internal Med, 1144 Eastlake Ave E,LG-650, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",elibby@seattlecca.org,,"Coffey, David G./0000-0003-3544-8836",,,,,112,8,8,22,22,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Multiple clinical manifestations, such as enlarged kidneys filled with growing cysts, hypertension, and multiple extrarenal complications, including liver cysts, intracranial aneurysms, and cardiac valvular disease, show that ADPKD is a systemic disorder. New information derived from clinical research using molecular genetics and advanced imaging techniques has provided enhanced tools for assessing the diagnosis and prognosis for individual patients and their families. Phase 3 randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials have clarified aspects of disease management and a disease-modifying therapeutic drug is now available for patients with high risk of rapid disease progression. These developments provide a strong basis on which to make clear recommendations about the management of affected patients and families. Implementation of these advances has the potential to delay kidney failure, reduce the symptom burden, lessen the risk of cardiovascular complications, and prolong life.","[Cornec-Le Gall, Emilie] Ctr Hosp Univ, Serv Nephrol Hemodialyse & Transplantat Renale, Brest, France; [Cornec-Le Gall, Emilie] Univ Brest, INSERM, Genet Genom Fonct & Biotechnol UMR1078, Brest, France; [Cornec-Le Gall, Emilie] Univ Bretagne Occidentale, Brest, France; [Alam, Ahsan] McGill Univ, Ctr Hlth, Div Nephrol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Perrone, Ronald D.] Tufts Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Nephrol, Boston, MA 02111 USA",,"Perrone, RD (corresponding author), Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Tufts Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",rperrone@tuftsmedicalcenter.org,"Gall, Emilie Cornec-Le/AAJ-8467-2020","CORNEC-LE GALL, Emilie/0000-0003-1958-4459",,,,,138,147,147,5,47,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,MAR 2,2019,393,10174,,,,,919,935,,10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32782-X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32782-X,,,17,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,HN4AP,30819518,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000460126900031,View Full Record in Web of Science,49246,0,94,84,34,75,138,14,83,39,48,67,137,68,76,28,12

The primordial approach focuses on social determinants of health in populations: political, economic, and social factors, principally unplanned urbanisation, illiteracy, poverty, and working and living conditions. Implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals can lead to major improvements in cardiovascular health, and adequate health-care financing and universal health care are important for achieving these goals. Population-level interventions should focus on tobacco control, promotion of healthy foods (fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts), curbing unhealthy foods (saturated fats, trans fats, refined carbohydrates, excessive salt, and alcohol), promotion of physical activity in everyday living, and control of ambient and indoor pollution. At the individual level, identification of people at high multifactorial risk and guideline-driven management of hypertension, LDL cholesterol, and diabetes is required. Strategies to improve adherence to healthy lifestyles and drug therapies are essential and can be implemented at health system, health care, and patient levels with use of education, technology, and personalised approaches. Improving quality of medical education with a focus on ischaemic heart disease prevention for physicians, nurses, allied health workers, and the public is required.","[Gupta, Rajeev] Rajasthan Univ Hlth Sci, Acad Res Dev Unit, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India; [Gupta, Rajeev] Eternal Heart Care Ctr & Res Inst, Dept Prevent Cardiol & Internal Med, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India; [Wood, David A.] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Natl Inst Prevent & Cardiovasc Hlth, Galway, Ireland; [Wood, David A.] Imperial Coll, Natl Heart & Lung Inst, London, England",,"Gupta, R (corresponding author), Eternal Heart Care Ctr & Res Inst, M Floor, Jaipur 302017, Rajasthan, India.",drrajeev.gupta@eternalheart.org,,,,,,,126,39,39,0,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,AUG 24,2019,394,10199,,,,,685,696,,10.1016/S0140-6736(19)31893-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(19)31893-8,,,12,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,IT6UU,31448740,,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000483011200033,View Full Record in Web of Science,49435,0,98,1,22,96,96,79,111,57,40,49,15,77,118,34,110

OBJECTIVE To review the evidence on screening for AF in adults without prior stroke to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Cochrane Library, and trial registries through October 5, 2020; references, experts, and literature surveillance through October 31, 2021. STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of screening among asymptomatic persons without known AF or prior stroke; test accuracy studies; RCTs of anticoagulation among persons with AF; systematic reviews; and observational studies reporting harms. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers assessed titles/abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality and extracted data; when at least 3 similar studies were available, meta-analyses were conducted. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Detection of undiagnosed AF, test accuracy, mortality, stroke, stroke-related morbidity, and harms. RESULTS Twenty-six studies (N = 113 784) were included. In 1 RCT (n = 28 768) of twice-daily electrocardiography (ECG) screening for 2 weeks, the likelihood of a composite end point (ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, systemic embolism, all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for bleeding) was lower in the screened group over 6.9 years (hazard ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.92-1.00]; P = .045), but that study had numerous limitations. In 4 RCTs (n = 32 491), significantly more AF was detected with intermittent and continuous ECG screening compared with no screening (risk difference range, 1.0%-4.8%). Treatment with warfarin over a mean of 1.5 years in populations with clinical, mostly persistent AF was associated with fewer ischemic strokes (pooled risk ratio [RR], 0.32 [95% CI, 0.20-0.51]; 5 RCTs; n = 2415) and lower all-cause mortality (pooled RR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.50-0.93]) compared with placebo. Treatment with direct oral anticoagulants was also associated with lower incidence of stroke (adjusted odds ratios range, 0.32-0.44) in indirect comparisons with placebo. The pooled RR for major bleeding for warfarin compared with placebo was 1.8 (95% CI. 0.85-3.7; 5 RCTs; n = 2415), and the adjusted odds ratio for major bleeding for direct oral anticoagulants compared with placebo or no treatment ranged from 1.38 to 2.21, but CIs did not exclude a null effect. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although screening can detect more cases of unknown AF, evidence regarding effects on health outcomes is limited. Anticoagulation was associated with lower risk of first stroke and mortality but with increased risk of major bleeding, although estimates for this harm are imprecise; no trials assessed benefits and harms of anticoagulation among screen-detected populations.","[Kahwati, Leila C.; Asher, Gary N.; Kadro, Zachary O.; Keen, Susan; Ali, Rania; Coker-Schwimmer, Emmanuel; Jonas, Daniel E.] Univ N Carolina, RTI Int, Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Kahwati, Leila C.; Ali, Rania] RTI Int, 3040 E Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Asher, Gary N.; Keen, Susan] Univ N Carolina, Dept Family Med, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Kadro, Zachary O.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Coker-Schwimmer, Emmanuel; Jonas, Daniel E.] Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Internal Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",,"Kahwati, LC (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, RTI Int, Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.;Kahwati, LC (corresponding author), RTI Int, 3040 E Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",lkahwati@rti.org,,"Kadro, Zachary/0000-0003-3894-9804; Kahwati, Leila/0000-0001-6963-2848; Keen, Susan/0000-0003-1238-7006","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA-290-2015-00011-I]; National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health National Research Service Award (NRSA) Institutional Research Training Program (T32) at University of North Carolina [5T32AT003378-13, 5T32AT003378-14]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services; National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health National Research Service Award (NRSA) Institutional Research Training Program (T32) at University of North Carolina","This project was funded under contract HHSA-290-2015-00011-I, Task Order 15, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, to support the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).

Extensive basic and clinical scientific investigation has provided strong evidence that the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has a key role in migraine. This evidence led to the development of small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists and monoclonal antibodies targeting either CGRP or its receptor. Clinical trials investigating these therapies have consistently shown statistically significant efficacy for either the acute or preventive treatment of migraine. No serious safety or tolerability issues have been identified in the trials of the monoclonal antibody therapies. Although the appropriate place of these new migraine-specific therapies relative to other available acute and preventive treatments remains to be determined, a growing body of evidence shows that therapeutic approaches targeting CGRP have the potential to transform the clinical management of migraine.","[Charles, Andrew] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Goldberg Migraine Program, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Pozo-Rosich, Patricia] Hosp Univ Vall dHebron, Dept Neurol, Headache Unit, Barcelona, Spain; [Pozo-Rosich, Patricia] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Headache Res Grp, Vall dHebron Res Inst, Barcelona, Spain",,"Charles, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Goldberg Migraine Program, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",acharles@ucla.edu,,,"Eli Lilly; Novartis; Wendy and Leonard Goldberg Endowment; Meyer and Renee Luskin Chair in Migraine and Headache Studies at UCLA; Baldwin Foundation; Chiesi, Electrocore; Allergan; la Caixa Foundation; MINECO; AGAUR; Fundacio La Marato TV3, Instituto Investigacion Carlos III, Migraine Research Foundation, Mutual Medica","Eli Lilly(Eli Lilly); Novartis(Novartis); Wendy and Leonard Goldberg Endowment; Meyer and Renee Luskin Chair in Migraine and Headache Studies at UCLA; Baldwin Foundation; Chiesi, Electrocore(Chiesi Pharmaceuticals Inc); Allergan(AbbVieAllergan); la Caixa Foundation(La Caixa Foundation); MINECO(Spanish Government); AGAUR(Agencia de Gestio D'Ajuts Universitaris de Recerca Agaur (AGAUR)); Fundacio La Marato TV3, Instituto Investigacion Carlos III, Migraine Research Foundation, Mutual Medica","AC has received compensation as a consultant for Alder, Amgen, Biohaven, Eli Lilly, eNeura, and Novartis.

We aimed to estimate the total reductions in under-5 mortality that are associated with increased maternal and paternal education, during distinct age intervals. Methods This study is a comprehensive global systematic review and meta-analysis of all existing studies of the effects of parental education on neonatal, infant, and under-5 child mortality, combined with primary analyses of Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data. The literature search of seven databases (CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) was done between Jan 23 and Feb 8, 2019, and updated on Jan 7, 2021, with no language or publication date restrictions. Teams of independent reviewers assessed each record for its inclusion of individual-level data on parental education and child mortality and excluded articles on the basis of study design and availability of relevant statistics. Full-text screening was done in 15 languages. Data extracted from these studies were combined with primary microdata from the DHS for meta-analyses relating maternal or paternal education with mortality at six age intervals: 0-27 days, 1-11 months, 1-4 years, 0-4 years, 0-11 months, and 1 month to 4 years. Novel mixed-effects meta-regression models were implemented to address heterogeneity in referent and exposure measures among the studies and to adjust for study-level covariates (wealth or income, partner's years of schooling, and sex of the child). This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020141731). Findings The systematic review returned 5339 unique records, yielding 186 included studies after exclusions. DHS data were compiled from 114 unique surveys, capturing 3 112 474 livebirths. Data extracted from the systematic review were synthesized together with primary DHS data, for meta-analysis on a total of 300 studies from 92 countries. Both increased maternal and paternal education showed a dose-response relationship linked to reduced under-5 mortality, with maternal education emerging as a stronger predictor. We observed a reduction in under-5 mortality of 31.0% (95% CI 29.0-32.6) for children born to mothers with 12 years of education (ie, completed secondary education) and 17.3% (15.0-18.8) for children born to fathers with 12 years of education, compared with those born to a parent with no education. We also showed that a single additional year of schooling was, on average, associated with a reduction in under-5 mortality of 3.04% (2.82-3.23) for maternal education and 1.57% (1.35-1.72) for paternal education. The association between higher parental education and lower child mortality was significant for both parents at all ages studied and was largest after the first month of life. The meta-analysis framework incorporated uncertainty associated with each individual effect size into the model fitting process, in an effort to decrease the risk of bias introduced by study design and quality. Interpretation To our knowledge, this study is the first effort to systematically quantify the transgenerational importance of education for child survival at the global level. The results showed that lower maternal and paternal education are both risk factors for child mortality, even after controlling for other markers of family socioeconomic status.

We systematically reviewed the efficacy and safety of liberal versus conservative oxygen therapy in acutely ill adults. Methods In the Improving Oxygen Therapy in Acute-illness (IOTA) systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, HealthSTAR, LILACS, PapersFirst, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry from inception to Oct 25, 2017, for randomised controlled trials comparing liberal and conservative oxygen therapy in acutely ill adults (aged >= 18 years). Studies limited to patients with chronic respiratory diseases or psychiatric disease, patients on extracorporeal life support, or patients treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy or elective surgery were excluded. We screened studies and extracted summary estimates independently and in duplicate. We also extracted individual patient-level data from survival curves. The main outcomes were mortality (in-hospital, at 30 days, and at longest follow-up) and morbidity (disability at longest follow-up, risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia, any hospital-acquired infection, and length of hospital stay) assessed by random-effects meta-analyses. We assessed quality of evidence using the grading of recommend-ations assessment, development, and evaluation approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017065697. Findings 25 randomised controlled trials enrolled 16 037 patients with sepsis, critical illness, stroke, trauma, myocardial infarction, or cardiac arrest, and patients who had emergency surgery. Compared with a conservative oxygen strategy, a liberal oxygen strategy (median baseline saturation of peripheral oxygen [SpO(2)] across trials, 96% [range 94-99%, IQR 96-98]) increased mortality in-hospital (relative risk [RR] 1 . 21, 95% CI 1 . 03-1 . 43, I-2=0%, high quality), at 30 days (RR 1 . 14, 95% CI 1 . 01-1 . 29, I (2)=0%, high quality), and at longest follow-up (RR 1 . 10, 95% CI 1 . 00-1 . 20, I (2)=0%, high quality). Morbidity outcomes were similar between groups. Findings were robust to trial sequential, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses. Interpretation In acutely ill adults, high-quality evidence shows that liberal oxygen therapy increases mortality without improving other patient-important outcomes. Supplemental oxygen might become unfavourable above an SpO(2) range of 94-96%. These results support the conservative administration of oxygen therapy.","[Chu, Derek K.; Kim, Lisa H-Y; Zamiri, Nima; Jaeschke, Roman; Schunemann, Holger J.; Neary, John D.; Alhazzani, Waleed] McMaster Univ, Dept Med, Hamilton, ON L8N 3Z5, Canada; [Almenawer, Saleh A.] McMaster Univ, Div Neurosurg, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Jaeschke, Roman; Szczeklik, Wojciech; Alhazzani, Waleed] McMaster Univ, Dept Hlth Res Methods Evidence & Impact, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Young, Paul J.] Med Res Inst New Zealand, Wellington, New Zealand; [Young, Paul J.] Wellington Reg Hosp, Intens Care Unit, Wellington, New Zealand; [Szczeklik, Wojciech] Jagiellonian Univ, Med Coll, Dept Intens Care & Perioperat Med, Krakow, Poland",,"Alhazzani, W (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Dept Med, Hamilton, ON L8N 3Z5, Canada.",alhazzaw@mcmaster.ca,"Szczeklik, Wojciech/N-8096-2014","Szczeklik, Wojciech/0000-0002-1349-1123; Young, Paul/0000-0002-3428-3083; Chu, Derek/0000-0001-8269-4496; Schunemann, Holger/0000-0003-3211-8479",Health Research Council of New Zealand Clinical Practitioner Research Fellowship,Health Research Council of New Zealand Clinical Practitioner Research Fellowship,"This work was supported by a Health Research Council of New Zealand Clinical Practitioner Research Fellowship awarded to PJY.

However, there is much debate regarding the appropriate level of funding for health and care in the UK. In this Health Policy paper, we look at the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and historical spending in the UK and comparable countries, assess the role of private spending, and review spending projections to estimate future needs. Public spending on health has increased by 3.7% a year on average since the National Health Service (NHS) was founded in 1948 and, since then, has continued to assume a larger share of both the economy and government expenditure. In the decade before the ongoing pandemic started, the rate of growth of government spending for the health and care sector slowed. We argue that without average growth in public spending on health of at least 4% per year in real terms, there is a real risk of degradation of the NHS, reductions in coverage of benefits, increased inequalities, and increased reliance on private financing. A similar, if not higher, level of growth in public spending on social care is needed to provide high standards of care and decent terms and conditions for social care staff, alongside an immediate uplift in public spending to implement long-overdue reforms recommended by the Dilnot Commission to improve financial protection. COVID-19 has highlighted major issues in the capacity and resilience of the health and care system. We recommend an independent review to examine the precise amount of additional funds that are required to better equip the UK to withstand further acute shocks and major threats to health.","[Charlesworth, Anita] Hlth Fdn, London, England; [Charlesworth, Anita] Univ Birmingham, Coll Social Sci, Hlth Serv Management Ctr, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Anderson, Michael; Knapp, Martin; McGuire, Alistair; Mossialos, Elias; Street, Andrew; Woods, Michael] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Hlth Policy, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Donaldson, Cam] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Social Business & Hlth, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Johnson, Paul] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [McKee, Martin] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, London, England; [Smith, Peter] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Hlth Econ & Policy Innovat, London, England; [Smith, Peter] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England",,"Anderson, M (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Hlth Policy, London WC2A 2AE, England.",m.anderson5@lse.ac.uk,"Mossialos, Elias/ABE-1301-2021","Street, Andrew David/0000-0002-2540-0364; Smith, Peter/0000-0003-0058-7588",LSE Knowledge and Exchange Impact (KEI) fund from the Higher Education Innovation Fund,LSE Knowledge and Exchange Impact (KEI) fund from the Higher Education Innovation Fund,"Funding for the LSE-Lancet Commission on the future of the NHS was granted by the LSE Knowledge and Exchange Impact (KEI) fund, which was created using funds from the Higher Education Innovation Fund",,99,6,6,1,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,MAY 22,2021,397,10288,,,,,2012,2022,,10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00230-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00230-0,,MAY 2021,11,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),General & Internal Medicine,SF1XN,33965068,Green Accepted,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000652556000031,View Full Record in Web of Science,50070,0,35,65,71,12,10,43,4,54,34,68,6,51,87,54,50

The Rational Clinical Examination Systematic Review,JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION,,,English,Review,,,,,,,CRITERIA,"IMPORTANCE Syncope can result from a reduction in cardiac output from serious cardiac conditions, such as arrhythmias or structural heart disease (cardiac syncope), or other causes, such as vasovagal syncope or orthostatic hypotension. OBJECTIVE To perform a systematic review of studies of the accuracy of the clinical examination for identifying patients with cardiac syncope. STUDY SELECTION Studies of adults presenting to primary care, emergency departments, or referred to specialty clinics. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Relevant data were abstracted from articles in databases through April 9, 2019, and methodologic quality was assessed. Included studies had an independent comparison to a reference standard. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs). RESULTS Eleven studies of cardiac syncope (N = 4317) were included. Age at first syncope of at least 35 years was associated with greater likelihood of cardiac syncope (n = 323; sensitivity, 91%[95% CI, 85%-97%]; specificity, 72%[95% CI, 66%-78%]; LR, 3.3 [95% CI, 2.6-4.1]), while age younger than 35 years was associated with a lower likelihood (LR, 0.13 [95% CI, 0.06-0.25]). A history of atrial fibrillation or flutter (n = 323; sensitivity, 13%[95% CI, 6%-20%]; specificity, 98%[95% CI, 96%-100%]; LR, 7.3 [95% CI, 2.4-22]), or known severe structural heart disease (n = 222; range of sensitivity, 35%-51%, range of specificity, 84%-93%; range of LR, 3.3-4.8; 2 studies) were associated with greater likelihood of cardiac syncope. Symptoms prior to syncope that were associated with lower likelihood of cardiac syncope were mood change or prodromal preoccupation with details (n = 323; sensitivity, 2% [95% CI, 0%-5%]; specificity, 76%[95% CI, 71%-81%]; LR, 0.09 [95% CI, 0.02-0.38]), feeling cold (n = 412; sensitivity, 2%[95% CI, 0%-5%]; specificity, 89%[95% CI, 85%-93%]; LR, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.06-0.64]), or headache (n = 323; sensitivity, 3%[95% CI, 0%-7%]; specificity, 80% [95% CI, 75%-85%]; LR, 0.17 [95% CI, 0.06-0.55]). Cyanosis witnessed during the episode was associated with higher likelihood of cardiac syncope (n = 323; sensitivity, 8%[95% CI, 2%-14%]; specificity, 99%[95% CI, 98%-100%]; LR, 6.2 [95% CI, 1.6-24]). Mood changes after syncope (n = 323; sensitivity, 3%[95% CI, 0%-7%]; specificity, 83%[95% CI, 78%-88%]; LR, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.06-0.65]) and inability to remember behavior prior to syncope (n = 323; sensitivity, 5%[95% CI, 0%-9%]; specificity, 82%[95% CI, 77%-87%]; LR, 0.25, [95% CI, 0.09-0.69]) were associated with lower likelihood of cardiac syncope. Two studies prospectively validated the accuracy of the multivariable Evaluation of Guidelines in Syncope Study (EGSYS) score, which is based on 6 clinical variables. An EGSYS score of less than 3 was associated with lower likelihood of cardiac syncope (n = 456; range of sensitivity, 89%-91%, range of specificity, 69%-73%; range of LR, 0.12-0.17; 2 studies). Cardiac biomarkers show promising diagnostic accuracy for cardiac syncope, but diagnostic thresholds require validation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The clinical examination, including the electrocardiogram as part of multivariable scores, can accurately identify patients with and without cardiac syncope.","[Albassam, Omar T.; Redelmeier, Robert J.; Shadowitz, Steven; Etchells, Edward E.] Univ Toronto, Sunnybrook Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Albassam, Omar T.] King Abdulaziz Univ, King Abdulaziz Univ Hosp, Div Cardiol, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Husain, Aatif M.] Duke Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Durham, NC USA; [Husain, Aatif M.] Duke Clin Res Inst, Neurosci Med, Durham, NC USA; [Husain, Aatif M.] Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Neurodiagnost Ctr, Durham, NC USA; [Simel, David] Duke Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Div Gen Internal Med, Durham, NC USA; [Simel, David] Duke Univ, Durham, NC USA",,"Etchells, EE (corresponding author), Sunnybrook Hlth Sci Ctr, Div Gen Internal Med, 2075 Bayview Ave,Room H469, Toronto, ON M4N 3M5, Canada.",edward.etchells@sunnybrook.ca,"Husain, Aatif/AAN-7058-2021",,,,,,29,12,12,0,6,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Shortages in medications, health supplies, interruptions of basic utilities at health-care facilities, and the emigration of health-care workers have led to a progressive decline in the operational capacity of health care. The effect of the crisis on public health has been difficult to quantify since the Venezuelan Ministry of Health stopped publishing crucial public health statistics in 2016. We prepared a synthesis of health information, beyond what is available from other sources, and scholarly discussion of engagement strategies for the international community. Data were identified through searches in MEDLINE, PubMed, and the grey literature, through references from relevant articles, and governmental and non-governmental reports, and publicly available databases. Articles published in English and Spanish until Dec 1, 2018, were included. Over the past decade, public health measures in Venezuela have substantially declined. From 2012 to 2016, infant deaths increased by 63% and maternal mortality more than doubled. Since 2016, outbreaks of the vaccine-preventable diseases measles and diphtheria have spread throughout the region. From 2016 to 2017, Venezuela had the largest rate of increase of malaria in the world, and in 2015, tuberculosis rates were the highest in the country in 40 years. Between 2017 and 2018, most patients who were infected with HIV interrupted therapy because of a lack of medications. The Venezuelan economic crisis has shattered the health-care system and resulted in rising morbidity and mortality.

However, recent high-quality data, primarily in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, have made extracorporeal life support more widely accepted in clinical practice. OBSERVATIONS Clinical trials of extracorporeal life support for acute respiratory failure in adults in the 1970s and 1990s failed to demonstrate benefit, reducing use of the intervention for decades and relegating it to a small number of centers. Nonetheless, technological improvements in extracorporeal support made it safer to use. Interest in extracorporeal life support increased with the confluence of 2 events in 2009: (1) the publication of a randomized clinical trial of extracorporeal life support for acute respiratory failure and (2) the use of extracorporeal life support in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome during the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. In 2018, a randomized clinical trial in patients with very severe acute respiratory distress syndrome demonstrated a seemingly large decrease in mortality from 46% to 35%, but this difference was not statistically significant. However, a Bayesian post hoc analysis of this trial and a subsequent meta-analysis together suggested that extracorporeal life support was beneficial for patients with very severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. As the evidence supporting the use of extracorporeal life support increases, its indications are expanding to being a bridge to lung transplantation and the management of patients with pulmonary vascular disease who have right-sided heart failure. Extracorporeal life support is now an acceptable form of organ support in clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The role of extracorporeal life support in the management of adults with acute respiratory failure is being redefined by advances in technology and increasing evidence of its effectiveness. Future developments in the field will result from technological advances, an increased understanding of the physiology and biology of extracorporeal support, and increased knowledge of how it might benefit the treatment of a variety of clinical conditions.","[Brodie, Daniel] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, NewYork Presbyterian Hosp, Div Pulm Allergy & Crit Care Med, 630 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Brodie, Daniel] NewYork Presbyterian Hosp, Ctr Acute Resp Failure, New York, NY USA; [Slutsky, Arthur S.] Univ Toronto, Interdept Div Crit Care Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Slutsky, Arthur S.] St Michaels Hosp, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Inst, Keenan Ctr Biomed Res, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Combes, Alain] Sorbonne Univ, INSERM, Unite Mixte Rech UMRS 1166, Inst Cardiometab & Nutr, Paris, France; [Combes, Alain] Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, AP HP, Inst Cardiol, Serv Med Intens Reanimat, Paris, France",,"Brodie, D (corresponding author), Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, NewYork Presbyterian Hosp, 622 W 168th St,PH 8 East,Room 101, New York, NY 10032 USA.",hdb5@cumc.columbia.edu,"Slutsky, Arthur/M-3325-2019",,,,,,99,136,145,7,27,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Importance The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is updating its 2013 lung cancer screening guidelines, which recommend annual screening for adults aged 55 through 80 years who have a smoking history of at least 30 pack-years and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Objective To inform the USPSTF guidelines by estimating the benefits and harms associated with various low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening strategies. Design, Setting, and Participants Comparative simulation modeling with 4 lung cancer natural history models for individuals from the 1950 and 1960 US birth cohorts who were followed up from aged 45 through 90 years. Exposures Screening with varying starting ages, stopping ages, and screening frequency. Eligibility criteria based on age, cumulative pack-years, and years since quitting smoking (risk factor-based) or on age and individual lung cancer risk estimation using risk prediction models with varying eligibility thresholds (risk model-based). A total of 1092 LDCT screening strategies were modeled. Full uptake and adherence were assumed for all scenarios. Main Outcomes and Measures Estimated lung cancer deaths averted and life-years gained (benefits) compared with no screening. Estimated lifetime number of LDCT screenings, false-positive results, biopsies, overdiagnosed cases, and radiation-related lung cancer deaths (harms). Results Efficient screening programs estimated to yield the most benefits for a given number of screenings were identified. Most of the efficient risk factor-based strategies started screening at aged 50 or 55 years and stopped at aged 80 years. The 2013 USPSTF-recommended criteria were not among the efficient strategies for the 1960 US birth cohort. Annual strategies with a minimum criterion of 20 pack-years of smoking were efficient and, compared with the 2013 USPSTF-recommended criteria, were estimated to increase screening eligibility (20.6%-23.6% vs 14.1% of the population ever eligible), lung cancer deaths averted (469-558 per 100 000 vs 381 per 100 000), and life-years gained (6018-7596 per 100 000 vs 4882 per 100 000). However, these strategies were estimated to result in more false-positive test results (1.9-2.5 per person screened vs 1.9 per person screened with the USPSTF strategy), overdiagnosed lung cancer cases (83-94 per 100 000 vs 69 per 100 000), and radiation-related lung cancer deaths (29.0-42.5 per 100 000 vs 20.6 per 100 000). Risk model-based vs risk factor-based strategies were estimated to be associated with more benefits and fewer radiation-related deaths but more overdiagnosed cases. Conclusions and Relevance Microsimulation modeling studies suggested that LDCT screening for lung cancer compared with no screening may increase lung cancer deaths averted and life-years gained when optimally targeted and implemented. Screening individuals at aged 50 or 55 years through aged 80 years with 20 pack-years or more of smoking exposure was estimated to result in more benefits than the 2013 USPSTF-recommended criteria and less disparity in screening eligibility by sex and race/ethnicity.","[Meza, Rafael; Jeon, Jihyoun; Cao, Pianpian] Univ Michigan, Dept Epidemiol, 1415Washington Hts, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Toumazis, Iakovos; Bastani, Mehrad; Plevritis, Sylvia K.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biomed Data Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Toumazis, Iakovos; Bastani, Mehrad] Stanford Univ, Dept Radiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [ten Haaf, Kevin; Blom, Erik F.; de Koning, Harry J.] Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Han, Summer S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Quantitat Sci Unit, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Jonas, Daniel E.] Univ N Carolina, RTI Int, Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Jonas, Daniel E.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Internal Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Feuer, Eric J.] NCI, Div Canc Control & Populat Sci, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Kong, Chung Yin] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Radiol, Boston, MA USA; [Kong, Chung Yin] Mt Sinai Hosp, Dept Med, Div Gen Internal Med, New York, NY 10029 USA",,"Meza, R (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Epidemiol, 1415Washington Hts, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",rmeza@umich.edu,"Haaf, Kevin ten/AAI-3998-2020","Haaf, Kevin ten/0000-0001-5006-6938",,,,,39,42,42,5,9,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Renewed control efforts using a range of improved tools, such as long-lasting insecticide-treated bednets and artemisinin-based combination therapies, have more than halved the global burden of disease, but it remains high with 445 000 deaths and more than 200 million cases in 2016. Pitfalls in individual patient management are delayed diagnosis and overzealous fluid resuscitation in severe malaria. Even in the absence of drug resistance, parasite recurrence can occur, owing to high parasite densities, low host immunity, or suboptimal drug concentrations. Malaria elimination is firmly back as a mainstream policy but resistance to the artemisinin derivatives, their partner drugs, and insecticides present major challenges. Vaccine development continues on several fronts but none of the candidates developed to date have been shown to provide long-lasting benefits at a population level. Increased resources and unprecedented levels of regional cooperation and societal commitment will be needed if further substantial inroads into the malaria burden are to be made.","[Ashley, Elizabeth A.] Myanmar Oxford Clin Res Unit, 32A1 Kokkine Swimming Club Lane, Yangon, Myanmar; [Ashley, Elizabeth A.; Woodrow, Charles J.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Med, Ctr Trop Med & Global Hlth, Oxford, England; [Phyo, Aung Pyae] Shoklo Malaria Res Unit, Mae Sot, Thailand; [Phyo, Aung Pyae; Woodrow, Charles J.] Mahidol Univ, Fac Trop Med, Mahidol Oxford Trop Med Res Unit MORU, Bangkok, Thailand",,"Ashley, EA (corresponding author), Myanmar Oxford Clin Res Unit, 32A1 Kokkine Swimming Club Lane, Yangon, Myanmar.",liz@tropmedres.ac,"Phyo, Aung Pyae/K-2413-2019","Phyo, Aung Pyae/0000-0002-0383-9624; Woodrow, Charles/0000-0002-5134-7165; Ashley, Elizabeth/0000-0002-7620-4822",Wellcome Trust,Wellcome Trust(Wellcome TrustEuropean Commission),"We thank Kamolrat Silamut who created figure 2, and our colleagues and collaborators.

Eligible populations included unselected, asymptomatic individuals without known urinary tract conditions. Data Extraction and SynthesisIndependent critical appraisal and data abstraction by 2 reviewers. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to estimate benefits of the interventions. Main Outcomes and MeasuresSymptomatic infection; function, morbidity, mortality; pregnancy complications and birth outcomes. ResultsNineteen studies (N=8443) meeting inclusion criteria were identified. Two cohort studies (n=5289) found fewer cases of pyelonephritis in the cohorts of screened pregnant women (0.5%) than within retrospective comparisons of unscreened cohorts (2.2% and 1.8%); the larger study estimated a statistically significant relative risk of 0.30 (95% CI, 0.15-0.60). No studies examined screening in nonpregnant populations. Among 12 trials of asymptomatic bacteriuria screening and treatment during pregnancy (n=2377; 1 conducted within past 30 years), there were reduced rates of pyelonephritis (range, 0%-16.5% for the intervention group and 2.2%-36.4% for the control group; pooled risk ratio [RR], 0.24 [95% CI, 0.14-0.40]; 12 trials) and low birth weight (range, 2.5%-14.8% for the intervention group and 6.7%-21.4% for the control group; pooled RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.46-0.90]; 7 trials).

Study SelectionEnglish-language studies conducted in asymptomatic populations at general risk of CRC. Data Extraction and SynthesisTwo reviewers independently appraised the articles and extracted relevant study data from fair- or good-quality studies. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted. Main Outcomes and MeasuresColorectal cancer incidence and mortality, test accuracy in detecting cancers or adenomas, and serious adverse events. ResultsThe review included 33 studies (n=10776276) on the effectiveness of screening, 59 (n=3491045) on the test performance of screening tests, and 131 (n=26987366) on the harms of screening. In randomized clinical trials (4 trials, n=458002), intention to screen with 1- or 2-time flexible sigmoidoscopy vs no screening was associated with a decrease in CRC-specific mortality (incidence rate ratio, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.68-0.80]). Annual or biennial guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) vs no screening (5 trials, n=419966) was associated with a reduction of CRC-specific mortality after 2 to 9 rounds of screening (relative risk at 19.5 years, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.84-0.98]; relative risk at 30 years, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.65-0.93]). In observational studies, receipt of screening colonoscopy (2 studies, n=436927) or fecal immunochemical test (FIT) (1 study, n=5.4 million) vs no screening was associated with lower risk of CRC incidence or mortality. Nine studies (n=6497) evaluated the test accuracy of screening computed tomography (CT) colonography, 4 of which also reported the test accuracy of colonoscopy; pooled sensitivity to detect adenomas 6 mm or larger was similar between CT colonography with bowel prep (0.86) and colonoscopy (0.89). In pooled values, commonly evaluated FITs (14 studies, n=45403) (sensitivity, 0.74; specificity, 0.94) and stool DNA with FIT (4 studies, n=12424) (sensitivity, 0.93; specificity, 0.85) performed better than high-sensitivity gFOBT (2 studies, n=3503) (sensitivity, 0.50-0.75; specificity, 0.96-0.98) to detect cancers. Serious harms of screening colonoscopy included perforations (3.1/10000 procedures) and major bleeding (14.6/10000 procedures). CT colonography may have harms resulting from low-dose ionizing radiation. It is unclear if detection of extracolonic findings on CT colonography is a net benefit or harm. Conclusions and RelevanceThere are several options to screen for colorectal cancer, each with a different level of evidence demonstrating its ability to reduce cancer mortality, its ability to detect cancer or precursor lesions, and its risk of harms.

Public health surveillance data can inform an understanding of the evolution of the HIV epidemic in terms of the populations and geographical areas most affected. We analysed publicly available HIV surveillance data and census data to describe: current HIV prevalence and new HIV diagnoses by region, race or ethnicity, and age; trends in HIV diagnoses over time by HIV acquisition risk and age; and the distribution of HIV prevalence by geographical area. We reviewed published literature to explore the reasons for the current distribution of HIV cases and important disparities in HIV prevalence. We identified opportunities to improve public health surveillance systems and uses of data for planning and monitoring public health responses. The current US HIV epidemic is marked by geographical concentration in the US South and profound disparities between regions and by race or ethnicity. Rural areas vary in HIV prevalence; rural areas in the South are more likely to have a high HIV prevalence than rural areas in other US Census regions. Ongoing disparities in HIV in the South are probably driven by the restricted expansion of Medicaid, health-care provider shortages, low health literacy, and HIV stigma. HIV diagnoses overall declined in 2009-18, but HIV diagnoses among individuals aged 25-34 years increased during the same period. HIV diagnoses decreased for all risk groups in 2009-18; among men who have sex with men (MSM), new diagnoses decreased overall and for White MSM, remained stable for Black MSM, and increased for Hispanic or Latino MSM. Surveillance data indicate profound and ongoing disparities in HIV cases, with disproportionate impact among people in the South, racial or ethnic minorities, and MSM.","[Sullivan, Patrick S.; Pembleton, Elizabeth S.] Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA; [Johnson, Anna Satcher; Oster, Alexandra M.] US Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div HIV AIDS Prevent, Atlanta, GA USA; [Stephenson, Rob] Univ Michigan, Sch Nursing, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Justice, Amy C.] Yale Univ, Sch Med, West Haven, CT 06516 USA; [Althoff, Keri N.; Beyrer, Chris] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Bradley, Heather] Georgia State Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Castel, Amanda D.] George Washington Univ, Milken Inst Sch Publ Hlth, Washington, DC USA; [Rosenberg, Eli S.] SUNY Albany, Sch Publ Hlth, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Mayer, Kenneth H.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Mayer, Kenneth H.] Harvard Univ, Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,"Sullivan, PS (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30329 USA.",pssulli@emory.edu,,"Althoff, Keri/0000-0002-5068-6595; Satcher Johnson, Anna/0000-0002-8915-6903",Center for AIDS Research at Emory University [P30AI050409],Center for AIDS Research at Emory University,This work was supported by the Center for AIDS Research at Emory University (P30AI050409).

Clinically, it is classified as early-stage (medium-sized drusen and retinal pigmentary changes) to late-stage (neovascular and atrophic). Age-related macular degeneration is a multifactorial disorder, with dysregulation in the complement, lipid, angiogenic, inflammatory, and extracellular matrix pathways implicated in its pathogenesis. More than 50 genetic susceptibility loci have been identified, of which the most important are in the CFH and ARMS2 genes. The major non-genetic risk factors are smoking and low dietary intake of antioxidants (zinc and carotenoids). Progression from early-stage to late-stage disease can be slowed with high-dose zinc and antioxidant vitamin supplements. Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy (eg, ranibizumab, aflibercept, or bevacizumab) is highly effective at treating neovascular age-related macular degeneration, and has markedly decreased the prevalence of visual impairment in populations worldwide. Currently, no proven therapies for atrophic disease are available, but several agents are being investigated in clinical trials. Future progress is likely to be from improved efforts in prevention and risk-factor modification, personalised medicine targeting specific pathways, newer anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents or other agents, and regenerative therapies.","[Mitchell, Paul; Liew, Gerald; Gopinath, Bamini] Univ Sydney, Westmead Inst Med Res, Dept Ophthalmol, Ctr Vis Res, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Wong, Tien Y.] Duke Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore Natl Eye Ctr, Singapore Eye Res Inst, Singapore, Singapore",,"Mitchell, P (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Westmead Hosp, Westmead Inst Med Res, Ctr Vis Res,Dept Ophthalmol, Westmead, NSW 2145, Australia.",paul.mitchell@sydney.edu.au,"Wong, Tien Y/AAC-9724-2020","Wong, Tien Y/0000-0002-8448-1264","Australian National Health & Medical Research Council (Canberra, Australia)","Australian National Health & Medical Research Council (Canberra, Australia)","This work was supported by the Australian National Health & Medical Research Council (Canberra, Australia).",,133,435,457,13,121,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,SEP 29,2018,392,10153,,,,,1147,1159,,10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31550-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31550-2,,,13,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,GV3BV,30303083,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000445968800029,View Full Record in Web of Science,51584,0,4,105,60,31,17,72,133,115,108,74,64,61,39,66,123

Epidemiological trends in the past decade have shown that its incidence has declined gradually but progressively, and mortality has been reduced substantially. These findings probably reflect lifestyle and environmental changes, enhanced understanding of the pathogenesis and risk factors, population screening, advancements in imaging techniques, and individualised comprehensive chemoradiotherapy strategies. In particular, plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA has been used for population screening, prognostication, predicting treatment response for therapeutic adaptation, and disease surveillance. Moreover, the widespread application of intensity-modulated radiotherapy and optimisation of chemotherapy strategies (induction, concurrent, adjuvant) have contributed to improved survival with reduced toxicities. Among the existing developments in novel therapeutics, immune checkpoint therapies have achieved breakthroughs for treating recurrent or metastatic disease and represent a promising future direction in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.","[Chen, Yu-Pei; Sun, Ying; Ma, Jun] Sun Yat Sen Univ, State Key Lab Oncol South China, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Canc Med,Canc Ctr,Dept Rad, Guangdong Key Lab Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Diag &, Guangzhou 510060, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chan, Anthony T.

OBJECTIVE To assess clinical outcomes with convalescent plasma treatment vs placebo or standard of care in peer-reviewed and preprint publications or press releases of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). DATA SOURCES PubMed, the Cochrane COVID-19 trial registry, and the Living Overview of Evidence platform were searched until January 29, 2021. STUDY SELECTION The RCTs selected compared any type of convalescent plasma vs placebo or standard of care for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in any treatment setting. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers independently extracted data on relevant clinical outcomes, trial characteristics, and patient characteristics and used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. The primary analysis included peer-reviewed publications of RCTs only, whereas the secondary analysis included all publicly available RCT data (peer-reviewed publications, preprints, and press releases). Inverse variance-weighted meta-analyses were conducted to summarize the treatment effects. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES All-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, clinical improvement, clinical deterioration, mechanical ventilation use, and serious adverse events. RESULTS A total of 1060 patients from 4 peer-reviewed RCTs and 10 722 patients from 6 other publicly available RCTs were included. The summary risk ratio (RR) for all-cause mortality with convalescent plasma in the 4 peer-reviewed RCTs was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.63 to 1.38), the absolute risk difference was -1.21% (95% CI, -5.29% to 2.88%), and there was low certainty of the evidence due to imprecision. Across all 10 RCTs, the summary RR was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.92 to 1.12) and there was moderate certainty of the evidence due to inclusion of unpublished data. Among the peer-reviewed RCTs, the summary hazard ratio was 1.17 (95% CI, 0.07 to 20.34) for length of hospital stay, the summary RR was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.20 to 2.87) for mechanical ventilation use (the absolute risk difference for mechanical ventilation use was -2.56%[95% CI, -13.16% to 8.05%]), and there was low certainty of the evidence due to imprecision for both outcomes. Limited data on clinical improvement, clinical deterioration, and serious adverse events showed no significant differences. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Treatment with convalescent plasma compared with placebo or standard of care was not significantly associated with a decrease in all-cause mortality or with any benefit for other clinical outcomes. The certainty of the evidence was low to moderate for all-cause mortality and low for other outcomes.","[Janiaud, Perrine; Schmitt, Andreas M.; Gloy, Viktoria; Hemkens, Lars G.] Univ Basel, Univ Hosp Basel, Dept Clin Res, Basel, Switzerland; [Axfors, Cathrine; Haber, Noah A.; Goodman, Steven N.; Ioannidis, John P.

Outcomes from acute pancreatitis are influenced by risk stratification, fluid and nutritional management, and follow-up care and risk-reduction strategies, which are the subject of this review. ObservationsMEDLINE was searched via PubMed as was the Cochrane databases for English-language studies published between January 2009 and August 2020 for current recommendations for predictive scoring tools, fluid management and nutrition, and follow-up and risk-reduction strategies for acute pancreatitis. Several scoring systems, such as the Bedside Index of Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II tools, have good predictive capabilities for disease severity (mild, moderately severe, and severe per the revised Atlanta classification) and mortality, but no one tool works well for all forms of acute pancreatitis. Early and aggressive fluid resuscitation and early enteral nutrition are associated with lower rates of mortality and infectious complications, yet the optimal type and rate of fluid resuscitation have yet to be determined. The underlying etiology of acute pancreatitis should be sought in all patients, and risk-reduction strategies, such as cholecystectomy and alcohol cessation counseling, should be used during and after hospitalization for acute pancreatitis. Conclusions and RelevanceAcute pancreatitis is a complex disease that varies in severity and course. Prompt diagnosis and stratification of severity influence proper management. Scoring systems are useful adjuncts but should not supersede clinical judgment. Fluid management and nutrition are very important aspects of care for acute pancreatitis. This narrative review summarizes the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of acute pancreatitis, including advances in risk stratification, fluid and nutritional management, and follow-up care and risk-reduction strategies.","[Mederos, Michael A.; Reber, Howard A.; Girgis, Mark D.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Surg, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Girgis, MD (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, 10833 Le Conte Ave,14-174 CHS, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",mdgirgis@mednet.ucla.edu,,,,,,,66,47,51,43,85,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

We aimed to more precisely quantify the predictive potential of several markers, to determine which markers are most useful, and to establish an evidence base for quantitative recommendations for intakes of dietary fibre. Methods We did a series of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of prospective studies published from database inception to April 30, 2017, and randomised controlled trials published from database inception to Feb 28, 2018, which reported on indicators of carbohydrate quality and non-communicable disease incidence, mortality, and risk factors. Studies were identified by searches in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and by hand searching of previous publications. We excluded prospective studies and trials reporting on participants with a chronic disease, and weight loss trials or trials involving supplements. Searches, data extraction, and bias assessment were duplicated independently. Robustness of pooled estimates from random-effects models was considered with sensitivity analyses, meta-regression, dose-response testing, and subgroup analyses. The GRADE approach was used to assess quality of evidence. Findings Just under 135 million person-years of data from 185 prospective studies and 58 clinical trials with 4635 adult participants were included in the analyses. Observational data suggest a 15-30% decrease in all-cause and cardiovascular related mortality, and incidence of coronary heart disease, stroke incidence and mortality, type 2 diabetes, and colorectal cancer when comparing the highest dietary fibre consumers with the lowest consumers Clinical trials show significantly lower bodyweight, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol when comparing higher with lower intakes of dietary fibre. Risk reduction associated with a range of critical outcomes was greatest when daily intake of dietary fibre was between 25 g and 29 g. Dose-response curves suggested that higher intakes of dietary fibre could confer even greater benefit to protect against cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and colorectal and breast cancer. Similar findings for whole grain intake were observed. Smaller or no risk reductions were found with the observational data when comparing the effects of diets characterised by low rather than higher glycaemic index or load. The certainty of evidence for relationships between carbohydrate quality and critical outcomes was graded as moderate for dietary fibre, low to moderate for whole grains, and low to very low for dietary glycaemic index and glycaemic load. Data relating to other dietary exposures are scarce. Interpretation Findings from prospective studies and clinical trials associated with relatively high intakes of dietary fibre and whole grains were complementary, and striking dose-response evidence indicates that the relationships to several non-communicable diseases could be causal. Implementation of recommendations to increase dietary fibre intake and to replace refined grains with whole grains is expected to benefit human health. A major strength of the study was the ability to examine key indicators of carbohydrate quality in relation to a range of non-communicable disease outcomes from cohort studies and randomised trials in a single study. Our findings are limited to risk reduction in the population at large rather than those with chronic disease.

The global incidence of HCV was 23.7 cases per 100 000 population (95% uncertainty interval 21.3-28.7) in 2015, with an estimated 1.75 million new HCV infections diagnosed in 2015. Globally, the most common infections are with HCV genotypes 1 (44% of cases), 3 (25% of cases), and 4 (15% of cases). HCV transmission is most commonly associated with direct percutaneous exposure to blood, via blood transfusions, health-care-related injections, and injecting drug use. Key high-risk populations include people who inject drugs, men who have sex with men, and prisoners. Approximately 10-20% of individuals who are chronically infected with HCV develop complications, such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma over a period of 20-30 years. Direct-acting antiviral therapy is now curative, but it is estimated that only 20% of individuals with hepatitis C know their diagnosis, and only 15% of those with known hepatitis C have been treated. Increased diagnosis and linkage to care through universal access to affordable point-of-care diagnostics and pangenotypic direct-acting antiviral therapy is essential to achieve the WHO 2030 elimination targets.","[Spearman, C.

The government has since quadrupled its funding for health. The reform's first phase (2009-11) emphasised expanding social health insurance coverage for all and strengthening infrastructure. The second phase (2012 onwards) prioritised reforming its health-care delivery system through: (1) systemic reform of public hospitals by removing mark-up for drug sales, adjusting fee schedules, and reforming provider payment and governance structures; and (2) overhaul of its hospital-centric and treatment-based delivery system. In the past 10 years, China has made substantial progress in improving equal access to care and enhancing financial protection, especially for people of a lower socioeconomic status. However, gaps remain in quality of care, control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), efficiency in delivery, control of health expenditures, and public satisfaction. To meet the needs of China's ageing population that is facing an increased NCD burden, we recommend leveraging strategic purchasing, information technology, and local pilots to build a primary health-care (PHC)-based integrated delivery system by aligning the incentives and governance of hospitals and PHC systems, improving the quality of PHC providers, and educating the public on the value of prevention and health maintenance.","[Yip, Winnie] Harvard Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Chen, Angela T.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, China Hlth Partnership, Boston, MA USA; [Zhai, Tiemin] China Natl Hlth Dev Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Fu, Hongqiao; Jian, Weiyan] Peking Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Roman] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Sun Yat Sen Global Hlth Inst, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Xu, Roman] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst State Governance, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Pan, Jay] Sichuan Univ, West China Sch Publ Hlth, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Pan, Jay] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp 4, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Zhongliang] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Adm, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Chen, Qiulin] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Populat & Labor Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Mao, Wenhui] Duke Univ, Ctr Policy Impact Global Hlth, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Durham, NC USA; [Sun, Qiang] Shandong Univ, Sch Hlth Care Management, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Sun, Qiang] Shandong Univ, Natl Hlth Commiss, Key Lab Hlth Econ & Policy Res, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Hu, Min; Chen, Wen] Fudan Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Shanghai, Peoples R China",,"Yip, WN (corresponding author), Harvard Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",wyip@hsph.harvard.edu,"Xu, Dong/Z-1502-2019; Mao, Wenhui/T-3573-2019; Pan, Jay/Z-4492-2019","Xu, Dong/0000-0001-7438-632X; Mao, Wenhui/0000-0001-9214-7787; Pan, Jay/0000-0001-9501-1535; Chen, Angela/0000-0002-8418-1835",,,,,88,241,247,91,337,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,SEP 28,2019,394,10204,,,,,1192,1204,,10.1016/S0140-6736(19)32136-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(19)32136-1,,,13,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),General & Internal Medicine,JB8TF,31571602,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000488848800031,View Full Record in Web of Science,52515,0,32,69,38,59,32,3,48,67,46,33,68,35,79,10,87

OBJECTIVE To identify risk factors and physical findings that predict difficult intubation. DATA SOURCES The databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from 1946 to June 2018 and from 1947 to June 2018, respectively, and the reference lists from the retrieved articles and previous reviews were searched for additional studies. STUDY SELECTION Sixty-two studies with high (level 1-3) methodological quality that evaluated the accuracy of clinical findings for identifying difficult intubation were reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two authors independently abstracted data. Bivariate random-effects meta-analyses were used to calculate summary positive likelihood ratios across studies or univariate random-effects models when bivariate models failed to converge. RESULTS Among the 62 high-quality studies involving 33 559 patients, 10% (95% CI, 8.2%-12%) of patients were difficult to intubate. The physical examination findings that best predicted a difficult intubation included a grade of class 3 on the upper lip bite test (lower incisors cannot extend to reach the upper lip; positive likelihood ratio, 14 [95% CI, 8.9-22]; specificity, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.93-0.97]), shorter hyomental distance (range of <3-5.5 cm; positive likelihood ratio, 6.4 [95% CI, 4.1-10]; specificity, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.94-0.98]), retrognathia (mandible measuring <9 cm from the angle of the jaw to the tip of the chin or subjectively short; positive likelihood ratio, 6.0 [95% CI, 3.1-11]; specificity, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.90-1.0]), and a combination of physical findings based on the Wilson score (positive likelihood ratio, 9.1 [95% CI, 5.1-16]; specificity, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.90-0.98]). The widely used modified Mallampati score (>= 3) had a positive likelihood ratio of 4.1 (95% CI, 3.0-5.6; specificity, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.81-0.91]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although several simple clinical findings are useful for predicting a higher likelihood of difficult endotracheal intubation, no clinical finding reliably excludes a difficult intubation. An abnormal upper lip bite test, which is easily assessed by clinicians, raises the probability of difficult intubation from 10% to greater than 60% for the average-risk patient.","[Detsky, Michael E.] Sinai Hlth Syst, Dept Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Detsky, Michael E.; Adhikari, Neill K.; Friedrich, Jan O.; Scales, Damon C.] Univ Toronto, Interdept Div Crit Care Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Detsky, Michael E.; Adhikari, Neill K.; Friedrich, Jan O.; Scales, Damon C.] Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Jivraj, Naheed; Adhikari, Neill K.; Wijeysundera, Duminda N.; Scales, Damon C.] Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Jivraj, Naheed; Wijeysundera, Duminda N.] Univ Toronto, Dept Anesthesia, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Adhikari, Neill K.; Pinto, Ruxandra; Scales, Damon C.] Sunnybrook Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Crit Care Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Friedrich, Jan O.] St Michaels Hosp, Dept Crit Care Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Friedrich, Jan O.] St Michaels Hosp, Dept Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Friedrich, Jan O.; Wijeysundera, Duminda N.] St Michaels Hosp, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Simel, David L.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Simel, David L.] Durham Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Durham, NC USA; [Wijeysundera, Duminda N.] Univ Hlth Network, Dept Anesthesia & Pain Management, Toronto, ON, Canada",,"Scales, DC (corresponding author), 2075 Bayview Ave,Room D108, Toronto, ON, Canada.",damon.scales@sunnybrook.ca,"Jivraj, Naheed Kabirudeen/ABF-2936-2020; Wijeysundera, Duminda/L-3350-2018","Jivraj, Naheed Kabirudeen/0000-0002-4005-7015; Wijeysundera, Duminda/0000-0002-5897-8605",,,,,92,61,66,2,15,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Inflammation and fibrosis of bile ducts and the liver are followed by impaired bile formation or flow and progressive liver dysfunction. Patients might be asymptomatic at presentation or might have pruritus, fatigue, right upper quadrant pain, recurrent cholangitis, or sequelae of portal hypertension. The key diagnostic elements are cholestatic liver biochemistry and bile duct stricturing on cholangiography. Genetic and environmental factors are important in the cause of the disease, with the intestinal microbiome increasingly thought to play a pathogenetic role. Approximately 70% of patients have concurrent inflammatory bowel disease and patients require colonoscopic screening and surveillance. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is associated with increased malignancy risk and surveillance strategies for early cholangiocarcinoma detection are limited. No single drug has been proven to improve transplant-free survival. Liver transplantation is effective for advanced disease but at least 25% of patients develop recurrent disease in the graft.","[Dyson, Jessica K.; Jones, David E.

EoE affects both children and adults, and causes dysphagia, food impaction of the esophagus, and esophageal strictures. ObservationsEoE is defined by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction, such as vomiting, dysphagia, or feeding difficulties, in a patient with an esophageal biopsy demonstrating at least 15 eosinophils per high-power field in the absence of other conditions associated with esophageal eosinophilia such as gastroesophageal reflux disease or achalasia. Genetic factors and environmental factors, such as exposure to antibiotics early in life, are associated with EoE. Current therapies include proton pump inhibitors; topical steroid preparations, such as fluticasone and budesonide; dietary therapy with amino acid formula or empirical food elimination; and endoscopic dilation. In a systematic review of observational studies that included 1051 patients with EoE, proton pump inhibitor therapy was associated with a histologic response, defined as less than 15 eosinophils per high-power field on endoscopic biopsy, in 41.7% of patients, while placebo was associated with a 13.3% response rate. In a systematic review of 8 randomized trials of 437 patients with EoE, topical corticosteroid treatment was associated with histologic remission in 64.9% of patients compared with 13.3% for placebo. Patients with esophageal narrowing may require dilation. Objective assessment of therapeutic response typically requires endoscopy with biopsy. Conclusions and RelevanceEoE has a prevalence of approximately 34.4/100000 worldwide. Treatments consist of proton pump inhibitors, topical steroids, elemental diet, and empirical food elimination, with esophageal dilation reserved for patients with symptomatic esophageal narrowing. This review summarizes current evidence regarding the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis, a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the esophagus, and treatment approaches, including pharmacologic interventions, dietary therapy, and endoscopic dilation.","[Muir, Amanda] Univ Penn, Div Gastroenterol Hepatol & Nutr, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Falk, Gary W.] Univ Penn, Div Gastroenterol, Hosp Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,"Falk, GW (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Div Gastroenterol, Perelman Sch Med, Perelman Ctr Adv Med, 3400 Civ Ctr Blvd,7th Floor,South Pavil, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",gary.falk@pennmedicine.upenn.edu,,,,,,,63,1,1,3,4,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Importance Parkinson disease is the most common form of parkinsonism, a group of neurological disorders with Parkinson disease-like movement problems such as rigidity, slowness, and tremor. More than 6 million individuals worldwide have Parkinson disease. Observations Diagnosis of Parkinson disease is based on history and examination. History can include prodromal features (eg, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, hyposmia, constipation), characteristic movement difficulty (eg, tremor, stiffness, slowness), and psychological or cognitive problems (eg, cognitive decline, depression, anxiety). Examination typically demonstrates bradykinesia with tremor, rigidity, or both. Dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography can improve the accuracy of diagnosis when the presence of parkinsonism is uncertain. Parkinson disease has multiple disease variants with different prognoses. Individuals with a diffuse malignant subtype (9%-16% of individuals with Parkinson disease) have prominent early motor and nonmotor symptoms, poor response to medication, and faster disease progression. Individuals with mild motor-predominant Parkinson disease (49%-53% of individuals with Parkinson disease) have mild symptoms, a good response to dopaminergic medications (eg, carbidopa-levodopa, dopamine agonists), and slower disease progression. Other individuals have an intermediate subtype. For all patients with Parkinson disease, treatment is symptomatic, focused on improvement in motor (eg, tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia) and nonmotor (eg, constipation, cognition, mood, sleep) signs and symptoms. No disease-modifying pharmacologic treatments are available. Dopamine-based therapies typically help initial motor symptoms. Nonmotor symptoms require nondopaminergic approaches (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for psychiatric symptoms, cholinesterase inhibitors for cognition). Rehabilitative therapy and exercise complement pharmacologic treatments. Individuals experiencing complications, such as worsening symptoms and functional impairment when a medication dose wears off (off periods), medication-resistant tremor, and dyskinesias, benefit from advanced treatments such as therapy with levodopa-carbidopa enteral suspension or deep brain stimulation. Palliative care is part of Parkinson disease management. Conclusions and Relevance Parkinson disease is a heterogeneous disease with rapidly and slowly progressive forms. Treatment involves pharmacologic approaches (typically with levodopa preparations prescribed with or without other medications) and nonpharmacologic approaches (such as exercise and physical, occupational, and speech therapies). Approaches such as deep brain stimulation and treatment with levodopa-carbidopa enteral suspension can help individuals with medication-resistant tremor, worsening symptoms when the medication wears off, and dyskinesias.","[Armstrong, Melissa J.; Okun, Michael S.] Univ Florida, Coll Med, Dept Neurol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Armstrong, Melissa J.; Okun, Michael S.] Univ Florida, Fixel Inst Neurol Dis, Gainesville, FL USA",,"Armstrong, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Coll Med, Dept Neurol, McKnight Brain Inst, POB 100236, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA.",armstrong@neurology.ufl.edu,,"Armstrong, Melissa/0000-0002-2163-1907",,,,,78,454,482,108,311,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Our study presents insights from a collection of ten country case studies aiming to assess the provision of sexual, reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health and nutrition interventions in ten conflictaffected settings in Afghanistan, Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. We found that despite large variations in contexts and decision making processes, antenatal care, basic emergency obstetric and newborn care, comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care, immunisation, treatment of common childhood illnesses, infant and young child feeding, and malnutrition treatment and screening were prioritised in these ten conflict settings. Many lifesaving women's and children's health (WCH) services, including the majority of reproductive, newborn, and adolescent health services, are not reported as being delivered in the ten conflict settings, and interventions to address stillbirths are absent. International donors remain the primary drivers of influencing the what, where, and how of implementing WCH interventions. Interpretation of WCH outcomes in conflict settings are particularly context-dependent given the myriad of complex factors that constitute conflict and their interactions. Moreover, the comprehensiveness and quality of data remain limited in conflict settings. The dynamic nature of modern conflict and the expanding role of non-state armed groups in large geographic areas pose new challenges to delivering WCH services. However, the humanitarian system is creative and pluralistic and has developed some novel solutions to bring lifesaving WCH services closer to populations using new modes of delivery. These solutions, when rigorously evaluated, can represent concrete response to current implementation challenges to modern armed conflicts.","[Singh, Neha S.; Blanchet, Karl] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Hlth Humanitarian Crises Ctr, London, England; [Ataullahjan, Anushka; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.] Hosp Sick Children, Ctr Global Child Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Ndiaye, Khadidiatou] George Washington Univ, Milken Inst Sch Publ Hlth, Washington, DC USA; [Waldman, Ronald J.] George Washington Univ, Global Hlth Dept, Milken Inst Sch Publ Hlth, Washington, DC USA; [Das, Jai K.; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.] Aga Khan Univ, Ctr Excellence Women & Child Hlth, Karachi, Pakistan; [Das, Jai K.; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.] Aga Khan Univ, Inst Global Hlth & Dev, Karachi, Pakistan; [Wise, Paul H.] Stanford Univ, Dept Pediat, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Altare, Chiara; Sami, Samira; Tappis, Hannah; Spiegel, Paul] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Ahmed, Zahra] Somali Disaster Resilience Inst, Mogadishu, Somalia; [Sami, Samira] CDC Natl Ctr HIV AIDS Viral Hepatitis STD & TB Pr, Div HIV AIDS Prevent, Atlanta, GA USA; [Akik, Chaza; Ghattas, Hala] Amer Univ Beirut, Fac Hlth Sci, Ctr Res Populat & Hlth, Beirut, Lebanon; [Mirzazada, Shafiq] Aga Khan Univ, Kabul, Afghanistan; [Garces-Palacio, Isabel C.] Univ Antioquia, Sch Publ Hlth, Epidemiol Grp, Medellin, Colombia; [Langer, Ana] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth & Populat, Women & Hlth Initiat, Boston, MA USA; [Waldman, Ronald J.] Doctors World, New York, NY USA; [Blanchet, Karl] Univ Geneva, Grad Inst, Geneva Ctr Humanitarian Studies, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland",,"Blanchet, K (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Grad Inst, Geneva Ctr Humanitarian Studies, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",karl.blanchet@unige.ch,"Spiegel, Paul/AAL-3238-2021; Garcés-Palacio, Isabel C/AAE-8382-2020; Ataullahjan, Anushka/AAV-8082-2021; Bhutta, Zulfiqar/L-7822-2015","Ataullahjan, Anushka/0000-0001-5261-5523; Singh, Neha/0000-0003-0057-121X; Garces-Palacio, Isabel C./0000-0003-0531-276X; Bhutta, Zulfiqar/0000-0003-0637-599X","Centre for Global Child Health at the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids); International Development Research Centre [108416-002, 108640-001]; Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation [QZA-16/0395]; Bill AMP; Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1171560]; UNICEF [PCA 20181204]; Family LarssonRosenquist Foundation",Centre for Global Child Health at the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids); International Development Research Centre; Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation; Bill AMP; Melinda Gates Foundation(CGIAR); UNICEF; Family LarssonRosenquist Foundation,"We would like to thank all study respondents who took part in the key informant interviews, and the BRANCH consortium members who contributed to specific country case studies: Afghanistan (Wardah Ahmed, Zulfiqar A Bhutta, Jai K Das, Malika Fatima, Zahra Feroz, Sultana Jabeen, Shafiq Mirzazada, and Mohammed I Zubair); Colombia (Gladis Adriana Velez Alvarez, Edison Bedoya Bedoya, Jewel Gausman, Isabel C Garces-Palacio, Sara Milena Ramos Jaraba, Marlly Andrea Garcia Jimenez, Ana Langer, Laura Ruiz Sanchez, Maria Ochoa Sierra, Natalia Quiceno Toro, and Ivan Dario Arroyave Zuluaga); Democratic Republic of the Congo (Chiara Altare, Hamady Ba, Stephane Muzindusi Bikoro, Ghislain Bisimwa, Ties Boerma, Christopher Hook, Espoir Bwenge Malembaka, Jerome Pfaffmann, Thea Scognamiglio, Paul Spiegel, Hannah Tappis, and Maphie Tosha); Mali (Anushka Ataullahjan, Diego Bassani, Samba Diarra, Seydou Doumbia, Michelle F Gaffey, and Moctar Tounkara); Nigeria (Eskedar Dejene, Khadidiatou Ndiaye, Ume Nwanneamaka, Chinwenwo Weli, Christina Okere, Victory Inyang, Jennifer Tyndall, and Ron Waldman); Pakistan (Wardah Ahmed, Zulfiqar A Bhutta, Jai Das, Malika Fatima, Zahra Feroz, and Sultana Jabeen); Somalia (Zahra Ahmed, Anushka Ataullahjan, Abdirizak Dalmar, Michelle Gaffey, Mohamed Osman, and Chantal Umutoni); South Sudan (Ties Boerma, Nicole Lightman, Augustino Mayai, Wilfred Ochan, Samira Sami, Grace Sheehy, Paul Spiegel, Hannah Tappis, James Wanyama, and Hannah Wild); Syria (Chaza Akik, Linda Shaker Berbari, Karl Blanchet, Joanne Constantin, Jocelyn DeJong, Abdulkarim Ekzayez, Hala Ghattas, Zeina Jamaluddine, Katherine Lopes, Ghada Saad-Haddad, Aline Semaan, and Neha S Singh); and Yemen (Iman Ahmed Saleh Al-Gawfi, Eman Al-Kubati, Nagiba A Abdulghani AlShawafi, Huda BaSaleem, Sarah Elaraby, Shatha Elnakib, Fouad Othman, Nuzhat Rafique, Fouzia Shafique, Paul Spiegel, and Hannah Tappis).

The goal of asthma treatment is to achieve good asthma control-ie, to minimise symptom burden and risk of exacerbations. Anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator treatments are the mainstay of asthma therapy and are used in a stepwise approach. Pharmacological treatment is based on a cycle of assessment and re-evaluation of symptom control, risk factors, comorbidities, side-effects, and patient satisfaction by means of shared decisions. Asthma is classed as severe when requiring high-intensity treatment to keep it under control, or if it remains uncontrolled despite treatment. New biological therapies for treatment of severe asthma, together with developments in biomarkers, present opportunities for phenotype-specific interventions and realisation of more personalised treatment. In this Seminar, we provide a clinically focused overview of asthma, including epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical diagnosis, asthma phenotypes, severe asthma, acute exacerbations, and clinical management of disease in adults and children older than 5 years. Emerging therapies, controversies, and uncertainties in asthma management are also discussed.","[Papi, Alberto] Univ Ferrara, Dept Med Sci, Res Ctr Asthma & COPD, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy; [Brightling, Christopher] Univ Leicester, Dept Infect Immun & Inflammat, Inst Lung Hlth, Leicester Natl Inst Hlth Res,Biomed Res Ctr, Leicester, Leics, England; [Brightling, Christopher] Univ Hosp Leicester NHS Trust, Leicester, Leics, England; [Pedersen, Soren E.] Univ Southern Denmark, Kolding Hosp, Dept Paediat, Kolding, Denmark; [Reddel, Helen K.] Univ Sydney, Clin Management Grp, Woolcock Inst Med Res, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Reddel, Helen K.] Univ Sydney, NHMRC Ctr Res Excellence Severe Asthma, Woolcock Inst Med Res, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"Papi, A (corresponding author), Univ Ferrara, Dept Med Sci, Res Ctr Asthma & COPD, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy.",ppa@unife.it,"Papi, alberto/AAC-1888-2019; Reddel, Helen/ABD-6338-2021; Reddel, Helen/AAC-3394-2020","Reddel, Helen/0000-0002-6695-6350; brightling, chris/0000-0002-9345-4903",,,,,142,831,894,82,493,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,FEB 24,2018,391,10122,,,,,783,800,,10.1016/S0140-6736(17)33311-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)33311-1,,,18,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,FX4ND,29273246,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000426054000029,View Full Record in Web of Science,52814,0,127,63,85,13,60,90,118,52,130,38,17,86,45,17,2

The incidence and prevalence of chronic pancreatitis is rising and no curative treatment is available. Using novel diagnostic algorithms, definitive chronic pancreatitis can be diagnosed by imaging criteria alone, whereas probable chronic pancreatitis requires clinical features and imaging criteria. Criteria for the diagnosis of early chronic pancreatitis are still under discussion and need prospective validation in clinical trials. Cross-sectional imaging should be used first; endoscopic ultrasound is needed only when CT or MRI are inconclusive or to plan therapeutic interventions. Management of chronic pancreatitis requires an interdisciplinary approach including primary care practitioners, gastroenterologists, surgeons, radiologists, pain specialists, and nutritional therapists. Patients with chronic pancreatitis should be seen at least once a year and re-evaluated for causal risk factors, symptom control, and complications such as malnutrition, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, and diabetes; refer to a specialised centre if symptoms are poorly controlled or there is risk of deterioration. Scoring systems to monitor disease progression have been developed and validated internationally. Interventional treatments for pain or cholestasis should be done by specialists only, and early discussion of treatment approaches should include all medical disciplines involved in care. Throughout this Seminar, we address research needs such as staging of pancreatitis, aspects of malnutrition and pain, and cancer surveillance, to help improve the care of patients.","[Beyer, Georg; Mayerle, Julia] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Univ Hosp, Med Dept 2, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Werner, Jens] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Univ Hosp, Dept Gen Visceral & Transplant Surg, Munich, Germany; [Habtezion, Aida] Stanford Univ, Stanford Med, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lerch, Markus M.] Univ Greifswald, Univ Med, Dept Med A, Greifswald, Germany",,"Mayerle, J (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Univ Hosp, Med Dept 2, D-81377 Munich, Germany.",julia.mayerle@med.uni-muenchen.de,"Lerch, Markus M./E-2206-2016; Beyer, Georg/AAX-4992-2021; Hirschfield, Gideon M/M-2143-2015","Lerch, Markus M./0000-0002-9643-8263; Beyer, Georg/0000-0002-7607-8264; Hirschfield, Gideon M/0000-0002-6736-2255","US National Institutes of Health [DK105263, DK108300]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SE 2702/2-1, GRK 1947, SFB-1321, 329628492, GRK 1947/A4]; PePPP Center of Excellence [MV ESF/14-BM-A55-0045/16]; RESPONSEproject (German Federal Ministry of Education and Research) [03ZZ0921E]; EU [777111]; Deutsche Krebshilfe; Dr Mildred Scheel Stiftung Predict PACA; EU; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01EK1511A]",US National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); PePPP Center of Excellence; RESPONSEproject (German Federal Ministry of Education and Research); EU(European Commission); Deutsche Krebshilfe(Deutsche Krebshilfe); Dr Mildred Scheel Stiftung Predict PACA; EU(European Commission); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"We thank Jan D'Haese MD (Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, University Hospital, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Germany) and Steffen Ormanns MD (Institute of Pathology, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Germany) for providing clinical and histopathological images used in figure 2 and the appendix pp 1 and 4.

Core features include excessive fear and anxiety or avoidance of perceived threats that are persistent and impairing. Anxiety disorders involve dysfunction in brain circuits that respond to danger. Risk for anxiety disorders is influenced by genetic factors, environmental factors, and their epigenetic relations. Anxiety disorders are often comorbid with one another and with other mental disorders, especially depression, as well as with somatic disorders. Such comorbidity generally signifies more severe symptoms, greater clinical burden, and greater treatment difficulty. Reducing the large burden of disease from anxiety disorders in individuals and worldwide can be best achieved by timely, accurate disease detection and adequate treatment administration, scaling up of treatments when needed. Evidence-based psychotherapy (particularly cognitive behavioural therapy) and psychoactive medications (particularly serotonergic compounds) are both effective, facilitating patients' choices in therapeutic decisions. Although promising, no enduring preventive measures are available, and, along with frequent therapy resistance, clinical needs remain unaddressed. Ongoing research efforts tackle these problems, and future efforts should seek individualised, more effective approaches for treatment with precision medicine.","[Penninx, Brenda W. J.

The most recent data indicate that, by 2050, the prevalence of dementia will double in Europe and triple worldwide, and that estimate is 3 times higher when based on a biological (rather than clinical) definition of Alzheimer's disease. The earliest phase of Alzheimer's disease (cellular phase) happens in parallel with accumulating amyloid beta, inducing the spread of tau pathology. The risk of Alzheimer's disease is 60-80% dependent on heritable factors, with more than 40 Alzheimer's disease-associated genetic risk loci already identified, of which the APOE alleles have the strongest association with the disease. Novel biomarkers include PET scans and plasma assays for amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau, which show great promise for clinical and research use. Multidomain lifestyle-based prevention trials suggest cognitive benefits in participants with increased risk of dementia. Lifestyle factors do not directly affect Alzheimer's disease pathology, but can still contribute to a positive outcome in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Promising pharmacological treatments are poised at advanced stages of clinical trials and include anti-amyloid beta, anti-tau, and anti-inflammatory strategies.","[Scheltens, Philip; Holstege, Henne; van der Flier, Wiesje M.] Amsterdam Univ Med Ctr, Alzheimer Ctr Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Scheltens, Philip] Amsterdam Univ Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, NL-1081 HX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Holstege, Henne] Amsterdam Univ Med Ctr, Dept Clin Genet, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Teunissen, Charlotte E.] Amsterdam Univ Med Ctr, Dept Clin Chem, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van der Flier, Wiesje M.] Amsterdam Univ Med Ctr, Dept Epidemiol & Datasci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Scheltens, Philip] Life Sci Partners, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [De Strooper, Bart] VIB Ctr Brain & Dis Res, Leuven, Belgium; [De Strooper, Bart] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Neurol, Leuven, Belgium; [De Strooper, Bart] UCL, Dementia Res Inst, London, England; [Kivipelto, Miia] Karolinska Univ Hosp, Div Clin Geriatr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Kivipelto, Miia] Karolinska Univ Hosp, Ctr Alzheimer Res, Stockholm, Sweden; [Kivipelto, Miia] Karolinska Univ Hosp, Dept Neurobiol Care Sci & Soc, Stockholm, Sweden; [Kivipelto, Miia] Univ Eastern Finland, Inst Publ Hlth & Clin Nutr, Kuopio, Finland; Imperial Coll London, Sch Publ Hlth, Ageing & Epidemiol Res Unit, London, England; [Chetelat, Gael] Univ Caen, Normandie Univ, INSERM, Gtp Interet Publ Cyceron, Caen, France; [Cummings, Jeffrey] Univ Nevada, Dept Brain Hlth, Chambers Grundy Ctr Transformat Neurosci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Cummings, Jeffrey] Cleveland Clin, Lou Ruvo Ctr Brain Hlth, Las Vegas, NV USA",,"Scheltens, P (corresponding author), Amsterdam Univ Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, NL-1081 HX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",p.scheltens@amsterdamumc.nl,"; Hardy, John/C-2451-2009","Scheltens, Philip/0000-0002-1046-6408; Gael, Chetelat/0000-0002-4889-7932; De Strooper, Bart/0000-0001-5455-5819; Hardy, John/0000-0002-3122-0423",Stichting Alzheimer Nederland; Stichting VUmc Fonds; Pasman Stichting; JPND [ZonMW 733051102]; MRC [UKDRI-1009] Funding Source: UKRI,Stichting Alzheimer Nederland; Stichting VUmc Fonds; Pasman Stichting; JPND; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),Research at the Alzheimer Center Amsterdam is part of the neurodegeneration research programme of Amsterdam Neuroscience.

OBJECTIVE To summarize the advances in diagnosis and treatment of VTE of the past 5 years. EVIDENCE REVIEW A systematic search was conducted in EMBASE Classic, EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, and other nonindexed citations using broad terms for diagnosis and treatment of VTE to find systematic reviews and meta-analyses, randomized trials, and prospective cohort studies published between January 1, 2013, and July 31, 2018. The 10th edition of the American College of Chest Physicians Antithrombotic Therapy Guidelines was screened to identify additional studies. Screening of titles, abstracts, and, subsequently, full-text articles was performed in duplicate, as well as data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment of the included articles. FINDINGS Thirty-two articles were included in this review. The application of an age-adjusted D-dimer threshold in patients with suspected PE has increased the number of patients in whom imaging can be withheld. The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria safely exclude PE when the pretest probability is low. The introduction of direct oral anticoagulants has allowed for a simplified treatment of VTE with a lower risk of bleeding regardless of etiology or extent of the VTE (except for massive PE) and has made extended secondary prevention more acceptable. Thrombolysis is best reserved for patients with massive PE or those with DVT and threatened limb loss. Insertion of inferior vena cava filters should be avoided unless anticoagulation is absolutely contraindicated in patients with recent acute VTE. Graduated compression stockings are no longer recommended to treat DVT but may be used when acute or chronic symptoms are present. Anticoagulation may no longer be indicated for patients with isolated distal DVT at low risk of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Over the past 5 years, substantial progress has been made in VTE management, allowing for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies tailored to individual patient characteristics, preferences, and values.","[Tritschler, Tobias] Univ Bern, Bern Univ Hosp, Inselspital, Dept Gen Internal Med, Bern, Switzerland; [Kraaijpoel, Noemie] Acad Med Ctr, Dept Vasc Med, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Le Gal, Gregoire; Wells, Philip S.] Ottawa Hosp, Res Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Le Gal, Gregoire; Wells, Philip S.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada",,"Wells, PS (corresponding author), Ottawa Hosp, 501 Smyth Rd,POB 206, Ottawa, ON K1H 8L6, Canada.",pwells@toh.ca,"Tritschler, Tobias/ABH-1772-2021","Tritschler, Tobias/0000-0002-8775-0511",Swiss National Science Foundation [SNSF P2ZHP3_177999]; Province of Ontario; Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario; Bristol-Myers Squibb/Pfizer,Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); Province of Ontario; Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario(Heart & Stroke Foundation of Ontario); Bristol-Myers Squibb/Pfizer(Bristol-Myers SquibbPfizer),"All authors have completed and submitted the ICMJE Form for Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest.

The prevalence of childhood stunting has fallen, and linear growth faltering in early life has become less pronounced over time, markedly in middle-income countries but less so in low-income countries. Stunting and wasting remain public health problems in low-income countries, where 4.7% of children are simultaneously affected by both, a condition associated with a 4.8-times increase in mortality. New evidence shows that stunting and wasting might already be present at birth, and that the incidence of both conditions peaks in the first 6 months of life. Global low birthweight prevalence declined slowly at about 1.0% a year. Knowledge has accumulated on the short-term and long-term consequences of child undernutrition and on its adverse effect on adult human capital. Existing data on vitamin A deficiency among children suggest persisting high prevalence in Africa and south Asia. Zinc deficiency affects close to half of all children in the few countries with data. New evidence on the causes of poor growth points towards subclinical inflammation and environmental enteric dysfunction. Among women of reproductive age, the prevalence of low body-mass index has been reduced by half in middle-income countries, but trends in short stature prevalence are less evident. Both conditions are associated with poor outcomes for mothers and their children, whereas data on gestational weight gain are scarce. Data on the micronutrient status of women are conspicuously scarce, which constitutes an unacceptable data gap. Prevalence of anaemia in women remains high and unabated in many countries. Social inequalities are evident for many forms of undernutrition in women and children, suggesting a key role for poverty and low education, and reinforcing the need for multisectoral actions to accelerate progress. Despite little progress in some areas, maternal and child undernutrition remains a major global health concern, particularly as improvements since 2000 might be offset by the COVID-19 pandemic.","[Victora, Cesar G.; Vidaletti, Luis Paulo; Gatica-Dominguez, Giovanna] Univ Fed Pelotas, Int Ctr Equ Hlth, BR-96020220 Pelotas, RS, Brazil; [Christian, Parul; Black, Robert E.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Menon, Purnima] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Poverty Hlth & Nutr Div, New Delhi, India",,"Victora, CG (corresponding author), Univ Fed Pelotas, Int Ctr Equ Hlth, BR-96020220 Pelotas, RS, Brazil.",cvictora@equidade.org,,,,,,,98,87,87,15,39,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,APR 10,2021,397,10282,,,,,1388,1399,,10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00394-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00394-9,,APR 2021,12,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,RK3RT,33691094,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000638217400027,View Full Record in Web of Science,53835,0,26,86,10,83,51,27,48,98,90,3,28,23,46,40,67

These factors cause maternal vascular endothelial injury, which leads to hypertension and multi-organ injury. The placental disease can cause fetal growth restriction and stillbirth. Pre-eclampsia is a major cause of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity, especially in low-income and middle-income countries. Prophylactic low-dose aspirin can reduce the risk of preterm pre-eclampsia, but once pre-eclampsia has been diagnosed there are no curative treatments except for delivery, and no drugs have been shown to influence disease progression. Timing of delivery is planned to optimise fetal and maternal outcomes. Clinical trials have reported diagnostic and prognostic strategies that could improve fetal and maternal outcomes and have evaluated the optimal timing of birth in women with late preterm pre-eclampsia. Ongoing studies are evaluating the efficacy, dose, and timing of aspirin and calcium to prevent pre-eclampsia and are evaluating other drugs to control hypertension or ameliorate disease progression.","[Chappell, Lucy C.] Kings Coll London, Sch Life Course Sci, Dept Women & Childrens Hlth, London SE1 7EH, England; [Cluver, Catherine A.] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Obstet & Gynaecol, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Cluver, Catherine A.] Tygerberg Hosp, Cape Town, South Africa; [Kingdom, John] Univ Toronto, Dept Obstet & Gynaecol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Tong, Stephen] Univ Melbourne, Dept Obstet & Gynaecol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Tong, Stephen] Mercy Hosp Women, Heidelberg, Vic, Australia",,"Chappell, LC (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Sch Life Course Sci, Dept Women & Childrens Hlth, London SE1 7EH, England.",lucy.chappell@kcl.ac.uk,"Cluver, Catherine/O-7978-2018","Cluver, Catherine/0000-0002-0406-8964",,,,,134,58,64,23,39,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,JUL 24,2021,398,10297,,,,,341,354,,10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32335-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32335-7,,JUL 2021,14,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,TM9EI,34051884,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000675849600026,View Full Record in Web of Science,53880,0,94,105,45,112,23,30,41,105,9,33,115,12,14,6,28

Importance In 2017, an estimated 7.9% of persons aged 12 to 17 years reported illicit drug use in the past month, and an estimated 50% of adolescents in the US had used an illicit drug by the time they graduated from high school. Young adults aged 18 to 25 years have a higher rate of current illicit drug use, with an estimated 23.2% currently using illicit drugs. Illicit drug use is associated with many negative health, social, and economic consequences and is a significant contributor to 3 of the leading causes of death among young persons (aged 10-24 years): unintentional injuries including motor vehicle crashes, suicide, and homicide. Objective To update its 2014 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on the potential benefits and harms of interventions to prevent illicit drug use in children, adolescents, and young adults. Population This recommendation applies to children (11 years and younger), adolescents (aged 12-17 years), and young adults (aged 18-25 years), including pregnant persons. Evidence Assessment Because of limited and inadequate evidence, the USPSTF concludes that the benefits and harms of primary care-based interventions to prevent illicit drug use in children, adolescents, and young adults are uncertain and that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms. More research is needed.

It is not yet clear what is driving this reversal of progress in tuberculosis control. Since 2000, the incarcerated population in central and South America has grown by 206%, the greatest increase in the world. Over the same period, notified tuberculosis cases among the incarcerated population (hereinafter termed persons deprived of their liberty [PDL], following the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights) have risen by 269%. In both central and South America, the rise of disease among PDL more than offsets tuberculosis control gains in the general population. Tuberculosis is increasingly concentrated among PDL; currently, 11% of all notified tuberculosis cases in central and South America occur among PDL who comprise less than 1% of the population. The extraordinarily high risk of acquiring tuberculosis within prisons creates a health and human rights crisis for PDL that also undermines wider tuberculosis control efforts. Controlling tuberculosis in this region will require countries to take urgent measures to prioritise the health of PDL.","[Walter, Katharine S.; Martinez, Leonardo; Andrews, Jason R.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Div Infect Dis & Geog Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Arakaki-Sanchez, Denise] Minist Hlth Brazil, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Sequera, Victor G.; Garcia-Basteiro, Alberto L.] Univ Barcelona, Hosp Clin, ISGlobal, Barcelona, Spain; [Sequera, Victor G.] Dept Hlth Surveillance, Asuncion, Paraguay; [Sanabria, G.

Further expansion in HIV treatment options, incorporating women-centred approaches, is essential to make individualised care a reality. With a longer life expectancy than before, people living with HIV are at an increased risk of developing non-AIDS comorbidities, such as cardiovascular diseases and cancers. Antiretroviral strategies are evolving towards a decrease in drug burden, and some two-drug combinations have proven efficacy for maintenance therapy.

Importance Carotid artery stenosis is atherosclerotic disease that affects extracranial carotid arteries. Asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis refers to stenosis in persons without a history of ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or other neurologic symptoms referable to the carotid arteries. The prevalence of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is low in the general population but increases with age. Objective To determine if its 2014 recommendation should be reaffirmed, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a reaffirmation evidence review. The reaffirmation update focused on the targeted key questions on the potential benefits and harms of screening and interventions, including revascularization procedures designed to improve carotid artery blood flow, in persons with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. Population This recommendation statement applies to adults without a history of transient ischemic attack, stroke, or other neurologic signs or symptoms referable to the carotid arteries. Evidence Assessment The USPSTF found no new substantial evidence that could change its recommendation and therefore concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis outweigh the benefits. Recommendation The USPSTF recommends against screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in the general adult population.

These targets are poverty reduction, health and wellbeing for all, equitable education, gender equality, and reduction of inequalities within and between countries. The interaction between inequalities and health is complex: better economic and educational outcomes for households enhance health, low socioeconomic status leads to chronic ill health, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) reduce income status of households. NCDs account for most causes of early death and disability worldwide, so it is alarming that strong scientific evidence suggests an increase in the clustering of non-communicable conditions with low socioeconomic status in low-income and middle-income countries since 2000, as previously seen in high-income settings. These conditions include tobacco use, obesity, hypertension, cancer, and diabetes. Strong evidence from 283 studies overwhelmingly supports a positive association between low-income, low socioeconomic status, or low educational status and NCDs. The associations have been differentiated by sex in only four studies. Health is a key driver in the SDGs, and reduction of health inequalities and NCDs should become key in the promotion of the overall SDG agenda. A sustained reduction of general inequalities in income status, education, and gender within and between countries would enhance worldwide equality in health. To end poverty through elimination of its causes, NCD programmes should be included in the development agenda. National programmes should mitigate social and health shocks to protect the poor from events that worsen their frail socioeconomic condition and health status. Programmes related to universal health coverage of NCDs should specifically target susceptible populations, such as elderly people, who are most at risk. Growing inequalities in access to resources for prevention and treatment need to be addressed through improved international regulations across jurisdictions that eliminate the legal and practical barriers in the implementation of non-communicable disease control.","[Niessen, Louis W.; Khan, Jahangir] Univ Liverpool Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Dept Int Publ Hlth & Clin Sci, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England; [Niessen, Louis W.; Mohan, Diwakar; Trujillo, Antonio; Peters, David H.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Akuoku, Jonathan K.] World Bank, Dept Hlth Nutr & Populat Global Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Ahmed, Sayem; Koehlmoos, Tracey P.] Icddr B, Hlth Syst & Populat Studies Div, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Mirelman, Andrew J.] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Koehlmoos, Tracey P.] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Prevent Med & Biostat, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Ahmed, Sayem; Khan, Jahangir] Karolinska Inst, Dept Management & Eth, Hlth Econ & Policy Res Grp, Stockholm, Sweden",,"Niessen, LW (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Dept Int Publ Hlth & Clin Sci, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England.",louis.niessen@lstmed.ac.uk,"Niessen, Louis/F-6254-2015; Mohan, Diwakar/S-2439-2019; Ahmed, Sayem/AAI-6500-2021; Khan, Jahangir/AAG-4014-2019; Ahmed, Sayem/G-1439-2015","Niessen, Louis/0000-0002-8639-5191; Mohan, Diwakar/0000-0002-7532-366X; Ahmed, Sayem/0000-0001-9499-1500; Ahmed, Sayem/0000-0001-9499-1500; KHAN, JAHANGIR/0000-0002-6151-764X","United Health Group; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes of the National Institutes of Health","United Health Group; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI))","The researchers received an unrestricted project grant from the United Health Group to do a systematic review.

Bipolar disorders substantially reduce psychosocial functioning and are associated with a loss of approximately 10-20 potential years of life. The mortality gap between populations with bipolar disorders and the general population is principally a result of excess deaths from cardiovascular disease and suicide. Bipolar disorder has a high heritability (approximately 70%). Bipolar disorders share genetic risk alleles with other mental and medical disorders. Bipolar I has a closer genetic association with schizophrenia relative to bipolar II, which has a closer genetic association with major depressive disorder. Although the pathogenesis of bipolar disorders is unknown, implicated processes include disturbances in neuronal-glial plasticity, monoaminergic signalling, inflammatory homoeostasis, cellular metabolic pathways, and mitochondrial function. The high prevalence of childhood maltreatment in people with bipolar disorders and the association between childhood maltreatment and a more complex presentation of bipolar disorder (eg, one including suicidality) highlight the role of adverse environmental exposures on the presentation of bipolar disorders. Although mania defines bipolar I disorder, depressive episodes and symptoms dominate the longitudinal course of, and disproportionately account for morbidity and mortality in, bipolar disorders. Lithium is the gold standard mood-stabilising agent for the treatment of people with bipolar disorders, and has antimanic, antidepressant, and anti-suicide effects. Although antipsychotics are effective in treating mania, few antipsychotics have proven to be effective in bipolar depression. Divalproex and carbamazepine are effective in the treatment of acute mania and lamotrigine is effective at treating and preventing bipolar depression. Antidepressants are widely prescribed for bipolar disorders despite a paucity of compelling evidence for their short-term or long-term efficacy. Moreover, antidepressant prescription in bipolar disorder is associated, in many cases, with mood destabilisation, especially during maintenance treatment. Unfortunately, effective pharmacological treatments for bipolar disorders are not universally available, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. Targeting medical and psychiatric comorbidity, integrating adjunctive psychosocial treatments, and involving caregivers have been shown to improve health outcomes for people with bipolar disorders. The aim of this Seminar, which is intended mainly for primary care physicians, is to provide an overview of diagnostic, pathogenetic, and treatment considerations in bipolar disorders. Towards the foregoing aim, we review and synthesise evidence on the epidemiology, mechanisms, screening, and treatment of bipolar disorders.","[McIntyre, Roger S.; Rosenblat, Joshua D.; Majeed, Amna; Mansur, Rodrigo B.] Univ Hlth Network, Mood Disorders Psychopharmacol Unit, Toronto, ON M5T 2S8, Canada; [McIntyre, Roger S.; Goldstein, Benjamin I.; Nierenberg, Andrew A.; Rosenblat, Joshua D.; Mansur, Rodrigo B.] Univ Toronto, Dept Psychiat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [McIntyre, Roger S.] Univ Toronto, Dept Pharmacol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [McIntyre, Roger S.] Brain & Cognit Discovery Fdn, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Berk, Michael] Deakin Univ, Inst Mental & Phys Hlth, Sch Med, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Berk, Michael] Deakin Univ, Clin Translat Strateg Res Ctr, Sch Med, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Berk, Michael] Barwon Hlth, Mental Hlth Drug & Alcohol Serv, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Berk, Michael] Orygen, Natl Ctr Excellence Youth Mental Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Berk, Michael] Florey Inst Neurosci & Mental Hlth, Ctr Youth Mental Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Berk, Michael] Univ Melbourne, Dept Psychiat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Brietzke, Elisa] Kingston Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Adult Div, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Brietzke, Elisa] Queens Univ, Dept Psychiat, Sch Med, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Brietzke, Elisa] Queens Univ, Ctr Neurosci Studies, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Goldstein, Benjamin I.] Sunnybrook Hlth Sci Ctr, Ctr Youth Bipolar Disorder, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Lopez-Jaramillo, Carlos] Univ Antioquia, Dept Psychiat, Fac Med, Medellin, Colombia; [Lopez-Jaramillo, Carlos] Hosp Univ San Vicente Fdn, Mood Disorders Program, Medellin, Colombia; [Kessing, Lars Vedel] Rigshosp, Psychiat Ctr Copenhagen, Copenhagen Affect Disorders Res Ctr, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Kessing, Lars Vedel; Vinberg, Maj] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Dept Psychiat, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Vinberg, Maj] Psychiat Ctr North Zealand, Psychiat Res Unit, Hillerod, Denmark; [Malhi, Gin S.] Univ Sydney, Northern Clin Sch, Discipline Psychiat, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Malhi, Gin S.] Northern Sydney Local Hlth Dist, Dept Acad Psychiat, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Rosenblat, Joshua D.] Harvard Med Sch, Dauten Family Ctr Bipolar Treatment Innovat, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Vieta, Eduard] Univ Barcelona, Inst Neurosci, Hosp Clin, IDIBAPS,CIBERSAM, Barcelona, Spain; [Young, Allan H.] Kings Coll London, Dept Psychol Med, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, London, England; [Young, Allan H.] South London & Maudsley Natl Hlth Serv Fdn Trust, Bethlem Royal Hosp, London, England",,"McIntyre, RS (corresponding author), Univ Hlth Network, Mood Disorders Psychopharmacol Unit, Toronto, ON M5T 2S8, Canada.",roger.mcintyre@uhn.ca,"Vinberg/ABC-7493-2021; Brietzke, Elisa/G-9559-2012; Vieta, Eduard/I-6330-2013","Vinberg/0000-0002-5982-1335; Brietzke, Elisa/0000-0003-2697-1342; Vieta, Eduard/0000-0002-0548-0053; Rosenblat, Joshua/0000-0002-4773-2191; Malhi, Gin/0000-0002-4524-9091; Lopez-Jaramillo, Carlos/0000-0002-1875-1369","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [PI15/00283, PI18/00805]; ISCIII-FEDER; CIBERSAM; Research of the Generalitat de Catalunya [2017 SGR 1365]; Health Department; CERCA Programme, Generalitat de Catalunya [SLT006/17/00357, PERIS 2016-20]","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); ISCIII-FEDER; CIBERSAM; Research of the Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); Health Department; CERCA Programme, Generalitat de Catalunya","EV thanks the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (PI15/00283 and PI18/00805) integrated into the National I+D+I Plan (cofunded by ISCIII-FEDER, CIBERSAM, and the Comissionate for Universities) and Research of the Generalitat de Catalunya to the Bipolar Disorders Group (2017 SGR 1365) and the project SLT006/17/00357, from PERIS 2016-20 (Health Department; CERCA Programme, Generalitat de Catalunya).

However, policies aimed at reducing consumption by increasing prices, for example by taxation, might impose an unfair financial burden on low-income households. We used data from household expenditure surveys to estimate patterns of expenditure on potentially unhealthy products by socioeconomic status, with a primary focus on low-income and middle-income countries. Price policies affect the consumption and expenditure of a larger number of high-income households than low-income households, and any resulting price increases tend to be financed disproportionately by high-income households. As a share of all household consumption, however, price increases are often a larger financial burden for low-income households than for high-income households, most consistently in the case of tobacco, depending on how much consumption decreases in response to increased prices. Large health benefits often accrue to individual low-income consumers because of their strong response to price changes. The potentially larger financial burden on low-income households created by taxation could be mitigated by a pro-poor use of the generated tax revenues.","[Sassi, Franco] Imperial Coll, Business Sch, Ctr Hlth Econ & Policy Innovat, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Belloni, Annalisa] Publ Hlth England, London, England; [Mirelman, Andrew J.; Suhrcke, Marc] Univ York, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Suhrcke, Marc] Luxembourg Inst Socioecon Res, Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Thomas, Alastair] Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, Paris, France; [Salti, Nisreen] Amer Univ Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon; [Vellakkal, Sukumar] Birla Inst Technol & Sci, Pilani, Goa, India; [Visaruthvong, Chonlathan] Minist Finance, Bangkok, Thailand; [Popkin, Barry M.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Nugent, Rachel] Res Triangle Inst Int, Seattle, WA USA",,"Sassi, F (corresponding author), Imperial Coll, Business Sch, Ctr Hlth Econ & Policy Innovat, London SW7 2AZ, England.",f.sassi@imperial.ac.uk,"Popkin, Barry/T-6633-2019; Vellakkal, Sukumar/AAD-4893-2020; Suhrcke, Marc/AAE-9024-2019","Nugent, Rachel/0000-0001-6421-9077; Suhrcke, Marc/0000-0001-7263-8626; Sassi, Franco/0000-0001-9773-2117; Vellakkal, Sukumar/0000-0002-0594-1454; Belloni, Annalisa/0000-0001-6214-0285",International Development Research Centre; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT [P2CHD050924] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,International Development Research Centre; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"We thank Robert Beaglehole, co-ordinator of The Lancet Taskforce on NCDs and economics.

We assessed whether a strategy of delayed versus early RRT initiation affects 28-day survival in critically ill adults with severe acute kidney injury. Methods In this systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomised trials published from April 1, 2008, to Dec 20, 2019, that compared delayed and early RRT initiation strategies in patients with severe acute kidney injury. Trials were eligible for inclusion if they included critically ill patients aged 18 years or older with acute kidney injury (defined as a Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes [KDIGO] acute kidney injury stage 2 or 3, or, where KDIGO was unavailable, a renal Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 3 or higher). We contacted the principal investigator of each eligible trial to request individual patient data. From the included trials, any patients without acute kidney injury or who were not randomly allocated were not included in the individual patient data meta-analysis. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at day 28 after randomisation. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019125025). Findings Among the 1031 studies identified, one study that met the eligibility criteria was excluded because the recruitment period was not recent enough, and ten (including 2143 patients) were included in the analysis. Individual patient data were available for nine studies (2083 patients), from which 1879 patients had severe acute kidney injury and were randomly allocated: 946 (50%) to the delayed RRT group and 933 (50%) to the early RRT group. 390 (42%) of 929 patients allocated to the delayed RRT group and who had available data did not receive RRT. The proportion of patients who died by day 28 did not significantly differ between the delayed RRT group (366 [44%] of 837) and the early RRT group (355 [43%] of 827; risk ratio 1 center dot 01 [95% CI 0 center dot 91 to 1 center dot 13], p=0 center dot 80), corresponding to an overall risk difference of 0 center dot 01 (95% CI -0 center dot 04 to 0 center dot 06). There was no heterogeneity across studies (I-2=0%; t(2)=0), and most studies had a low risk of bias. Interpretation The timing of RRT initiation does not affect survival in critically ill patients with severe acute kidney injury in the absence of urgent indications for RRT. Delaying RRT initiation, with close patient monitoring, might lead to a reduced use of RRT, thereby saving health resources. Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Classified by WHO as one of the most serious non-infectious diseases, psoriasis affects 2-3% of the global population. Mechanistically, psoriatic lesions result from hyperproliferation and disturbed differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes that are provoked by immune mediators of the IL-23 and IL-17 pathway. Translational immunology has had impressive success in understanding and controlling psoriasis. Psoriasis is the first disease to have been successfully treated with therapeutics that directly block the action of the cytokines of this pathway; in fact, therapeutics that specifically target IL-23, IL-17, and IL-17RA are approved for clinical use and show excellent efficacy. Furthermore, inhibitors of IL-23 and IL-17 intracellular signalling, such as TYK2 or ROR gamma t, are in clinical development. Although therapies that target the IL-23 and IL-17 pathway also improve psoriatic arthritis symptoms, their effects on long-term disease modification and psoriasis-associated comorbidities still need to be explored.","[Ghoreschi, Kamran] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Dept Dermatol Venereol & Allergy, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Sabat, Robert] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Psoriasis Res & Treatment Ctr, Berlin, Germany; [Balato, Anna] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Adv Biomed Sci, Naples, Italy; [Enerback, Charlotta] Linkoping Univ, Ingrid Asp Psoriasis Res Ctr, Dept Biomed & Clin Sci, Linkoping, Sweden",,"Ghoreschi, K (corresponding author), Charite Univ Med Berlin, Dept Dermatol Venereol & Allergy, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",kamran.ghoreschi@charite.de,,"Ghoreschi, Kamran/0000-0002-5526-7517",,,,,150,41,40,16,43,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,FEB 20,2021,397,10275,,,,,754,766,,10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00184-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00184-7,,FEB 2021,13,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,QL3PK,33515492,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000620991800034,View Full Record in Web of Science,56539,0,57,5,121,122,94,132,34,3,23,91,30,66,90,9,6

Progression to severe disease can prevent participation in normal activities because of deterioration of lung function. In 2020 it was estimated that approximately 6% of US adults had been diagnosed with COPD. Chronic lower respiratory disease, composed mainly of COPD, is the sixth leading cause of death in the US. OBJECTIVE To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a reaffirmation evidence update that focused on targeted key questions for benefits and harms of screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults and treatment in screen-detected or screen-relevant adults. POPULATION Asymptomatic adults who do not recognize or report respiratory symptoms.

As a preliminary step towards filling this guidance gap, we propose a conflict-specific framework that aims to guide decision makers focused on the health and nutrition of women and children affected by conflict to prioritise interventions that would address the major causes of mortality and morbidity among women and children in their particular settings and that could also be feasibly delivered in those settings. Assessing local needs, identifying relevant interventions from among those already recommended for humanitarian settings or universally, and assessing the contextual feasibility of delivery for each candidate intervention are key steps in the framework. We illustratively apply the proposed decision making framework to show what a framework-guided selection of priority interventions might look like in three hypothetical conflict contexts that differ in terms of levels of insecurity and patterns of population displacement. In doing so, we aim to catalyse further iteration and eventual field-testing of such a decision making framework by local, national, and international organisations and agencies involved in the humanitarian health response for women and children affected by conflict.","[Gaffey, Michelle F.; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.] Hosp Sick Children, Ctr Global Child Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Gaffey, Michelle F.; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Waldman, Ronald J.] George Washington Univ, Milken Inst Sch Publ Hlth, Washington, DC USA; [Waldman, Ronald J.] Doctors World USA, New York, NY USA; [Blanchet, Karl] Univ Geneva, Grad Inst, Geneva Ctr Humanitarian Studies, Geneva, Switzerland; [Blanchet, Karl] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Hlth Humanitarian Crises Ctr, London, England; [Amsalu, Ribka] Save Children, San Francisco, CA USA; [Amsalu, Ribka] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Obstet Gynecol & Reprod Sci, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Capobianco, Emanuele] Int Federat Red Cross & Red Crescent Soc, Geneva, Switzerland; [Ho, Lara S.] Int Rescue Comm, Washington, DC USA; [Ho, Lara S.; Spiegel, Paul B.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Ctr Humanitarian Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Black, Robert E.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Inst Int Programs, Baltimore, MD USA; [Khara, Tanya] Emergency Nutr Network, Oxford, England; [Garcia, Daniel Martinez] Operat Ctr Geneva, Med Sans Frontieres, Dept Med, Women & Child Hlth Unit, Geneva, Switzerland; [Ashorn, Per] Tampere Univ, Fac Med & Hlth Technol, Ctr Child Hlth Res, Tampere, Finland; [Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.] Aga Khan Univ, Ctr Excellence Women & Child Hlth, Karachi 74800, Pakistan; [Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.] Aga Khan Univ, Inst Global Hlth & Dev, Karachi 74800, Pakistan",,"Bhutta, ZA (corresponding author), Aga Khan Univ, Ctr Excellence Women & Child Hlth, Karachi 74800, Pakistan.;Bhutta, ZA (corresponding author), Aga Khan Univ, Inst Global Hlth & Dev, Karachi 74800, Pakistan.;Bhutta, ZA (corresponding author), Hosp Sick Children, Ctr Global Child Hlth, Toronto, ON M5G 0A4, Canada.",zulfiqar.bhutta@sickkids.ca,"Spiegel, Paul/AAL-3238-2021; Bhutta, Zulfiqar/L-7822-2015","AMSALU, RIBKA/0000-0001-8077-7685; Bhutta, Zulfiqar/0000-0003-0637-599X; Khara, Tanya/0000-0002-6251-0052; Ashorn, Per/0000-0003-2311-2593","International Development Research Centre [108416-002, 108640-001]; Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation [QZA-16/0395]; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1171560]; UNICEF [PCA 20181204]; Family Larsson-Rosenquist Foundation",International Development Research Centre; Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationCGIAR); UNICEF; Family Larsson-Rosenquist Foundation,"As coordinator of the Bridging Research & Action in Conflict Settings for the Health of Women & Children (BRANCH) Consortium, the SickKids Centre for Global Child Health has received funding for BRANCH research activities from the International Development Research Centre (108416-002 & 108640-001), Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (QZA-16/0395), Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1171560), and UNICEF (PCA 20181204).

Increases in airway type 2 cytokine activity, including interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, and IL-13, are now established biological mechanisms in asthma. Inhaled corticosteroids have been the foundation for asthma treatment, in a large part because they decrease airway type 2 inflammation. However, inhaled or systemic corticosteroids are ineffective treatments in many patients with asthma and few treatment options exist for patients with steroid resistant asthma. Although mechanisms for corticosteroid refractory asthma are likely to be numerous, the development of a new class of biologic agents that target airway type 2 inflammation has provided a new model for treating some patients with corticosteroid refractory asthma. The objective of this Therapeutic paper is to summarise the new type 2 therapeutics, with an emphasis on the biological rationale and clinical efficacy of this new class of asthma therapeutics.","[Peters, Michael C.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, Div Pulm & Crit Care Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Wenzel, Sally E.] Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth, Pittsburgh, PA USA",,"Peters, MC (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, Div Pulm & Crit Care Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.",michael.peters@ucsf.edu,"Peters, Michael/AAO-6544-2020","Wenzel, Sally/0000-0002-4242-0164; Peters, Michael/0000-0003-1854-4447","National Institutes of Health [K23 HL138303, P30 DK098722, U10 HL109152, AI106684-01A1, HL109152-05, 5UG1HL139098-02, GM114311-01A1]",National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health Grants: (K23 HL138303, P30 DK098722, U10 HL109152, AI106684-01A1, HL109152-05, 5UG1HL139098-02, GM114311-01A1).",,133,58,61,7,34,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,FEB 1,2020,395,10221,,,,,371,383,,,,,,13,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,KH7WI,32007172,Green Accepted,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000510860200038,View Full Record in Web of Science,57426,0,40,18,50,94,51,98,7,1,82,118,102,53,42,65,94

Treatment requires expert multidisciplinary care. Population-based screening has been ineffective, but new approaches for early diagnosis and prevention that leverage molecular genomics are in development. Initial therapy includes surgery and adjuvant therapy. Epithelial ovarian cancer is composed of distinct histological subtypes with unique genomic characteristics, which are improving the precision and effectiveness of therapy, allowing discovery of predictors of response such as mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, and homologous recombination deficiency for DNA damage response pathway inhibitors or resistance (cyclin E1). Rapidly evolving techniques to measure genomic changes in tumour and blood allow for assessment of sensitivity and emergence of resistance to therapy, and might be accurate indicators of residual disease. Recurrence is usually incurable, and patient symptom control and quality of life are key considerations at this stage. Treatments for recurrence have to be designed from a patient's perspective and incorporate meaningful measures of benefit. Urgent progress is needed to develop evidence and consensus-based treatment guidelines for each subgroup, and requires close international cooperation in conducting clinical trials through academic research groups such as the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup.","[Lheureux, Stephanie; Oza, Amit M.] Univ Toronto, Univ Hlth Network, Div Med Oncol & Hematol, Princess Margaret Canc Ctr, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada; [Gourley, Charlie] Univ Edinburgh, Western Gen Hosp, Nicola Murray Ctr Ovarian Canc Res, Edinburgh Canc Res UK Ctr,MRC IGMM, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Gourley, Charlie] Western Gen Hosp, Edinburgh Canc Ctr, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Vergote, Ignace] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Univ Ziekenhuizen Leuven, Dept Obstet & Gynaecol, Div Gynaecol Oncol,Leuven Canc Inst, Leuven, Belgium",,"Oza, AM (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Univ Hlth Network, Div Med Oncol & Hematol, Princess Margaret Canc Ctr, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada.",amit.oza@uhn.ca,,"Oza, Amit/0000-0002-9510-8641",,,,,147,498,528,33,171,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,MAR 23,2019,393,10177,,,,,1240,1253,,10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32552-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32552-2,,,14,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,HP9UL,30910306,Green Accepted,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000462038400031,View Full Record in Web of Science,57427,0,31,90,31,8,107,79,85,87,59,93,13,71,34,147,22

Advances in diagnosis, including the use of rapid molecular testing and whole-genome sequencing in both sputum and non-sputum samples, could change this situation. Although little has changed in the treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis, data on increased efficacy with new and repurposed drugs have led WHO to recommend all-oral therapy for drug-resistant tuberculosis for the first time ever in 2018. Studies have shown that shorter latent tuberculosis prevention regimens containing rifampicin or rifapentine are as effective as longer, isoniazid-based regimens, and there is a promising vaccine candidate to prevent the progression of infection to the disease.

Design, Setting, and Participants The AGReMA statement was developed using the Enhancing Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) methodological framework for developing reporting guidelines. The guideline development process included (1) an overview of systematic reviews to assess the need for a reporting guideline; (2) review of systematic reviews of relevant evidence on reporting mediation analyses; (3) conducting a Delphi survey with panel members that included methodologists, statisticians, clinical trialists, epidemiologists, psychologists, applied clinical researchers, clinicians, implementation scientists, evidence synthesis experts, representatives from the EQUATOR Network, and journal editors (n = 19; June-November 2019); (4) having a consensus meeting (n = 15; April 28-29, 2020); and (5) conducting a 4-week external review and pilot test that included methodologists and potential users of AGReMA (n = 21; November 2020). Results A previously reported overview of 54 systematic reviews of mediation studies demonstrated the need for a reporting guideline. Thirty-three potential reporting items were identified from 3 systematic reviews of mediation studies. Over 3 rounds, the Delphi panelists ranked the importance of these items, provided 60 qualitative comments for item refinement and prioritization, and suggested new items for consideration. All items were reviewed during a 2-day consensus meeting and participants agreed on a 25-item AGReMA statement for studies in which mediation analyses are the primary focus and a 9-item short-form AGReMA statement for studies in which mediation analyses are a secondary focus. These checklists were externally reviewed and pilot tested by 21 expert methodologists and potential users, which led to minor adjustments and consolidation of the checklists. Conclusions and Relevance The AGReMA statement provides recommendations for reporting primary and secondary mediation analyses of randomized trials and observational studies. Improved reporting of studies that use mediation analyses could facilitate peer review and help produce publications that are complete, accurate, transparent, and reproducible. Question What information should be reported in studies that include mediation analyses of randomized trials and observational studies? Findings An international Delphi and consensus process (using the Enhancing Quality and Transparency of Health Research methodological framework) generated a 25-item reporting guideline for primary reports of mediation analyses and a 9-item short form for secondary reports of mediation analyses. Meaning Using the 25-item or 9-item reporting guideline may facilitate peer review and could help ensure that studies using mediation analyses are completely, accurately, and transparently reported.","[Lee, Hopin; Lamb, Sarah E.; Hopewell, Sally; Collins, Gary S.] Univ Oxford, Ctr Stat Med, Nuffield Dept Orthopaed Rheumatol & Musaibskeleta, Oxford, England; [Lee, Hopin] Univ Newcastle, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Callaghan, NSW, Australia; [Cashin, Aidan G.] Univ New South Wales, Fac Med, Prince Wales Clin Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Cashin, Aidan G.; McAuley, James H.] Neurosci Res Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Lamb, Sarah E.] Univ Exeter, Coll Med & Hlth, Med Sch, Exeter, Devon, England; [Vansteelandt, Stijn] Univ Ghent, Dept Appl Math Comp Sci & Stat, Ghent, Belgium; [Vansteelandt, Stijn] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Med Stat, London, England; [VanderWeele, Tyler J.] Harvard Univ, TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [MacKinnon, David P.] Arizona State Univ, Dept Psychol, Phoenix, AZ USA; [Mansell, Gemma] Aston Univ, Coll Hlth & Life Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Collins, Gary S.] Oxford Univ Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, NIHR Oxford Biomed Res Ctr, Oxford, England; [Golub, Robert M.] JAMA Editorial Off, Chicago, IL USA; [Golub, Robert M.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Prevent Med, Div Gen Internal Med & Geriatr, Chicago, IL USA; [McAuley, James H.] Univ New South Wales, Fac Med, Sch Hlth Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"Lee, H (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Botnar Res Ctr, Nuffield Dept Orthopaed Rheumatol & Musculoskelet, Windmill Rd, Oxford OX3 7LD, England.",hopin.lee@ndorms.ox.ac.uk,"MacKinnon, David P./D-8727-2013; Collins, Gary S/A-2258-2014; Henschke, Nicholas/C-2975-2014; van Amelsvoort, Ludovic/A-3689-2008; Goldsmith, Kimberley/B-9107-2011","Collins, Gary S/0000-0002-2772-2316; Henschke, Nicholas/0000-0002-9624-2519; Lamb, Sarah/0000-0003-4349-7195; van Amelsvoort, Ludovic/0000-0003-0120-1552; Goldsmith, Kimberley/0000-0002-0620-7868; Mansell, Gemma/0000-0002-5479-2678; Rijnhart, Judith/0000-0002-1046-3741",,,,,42,18,18,4,8,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

The 2014 Lancet Series on the new discipline of mass gatherings medicine was launched at the World Health Assembly of Ministers of Health in Geneva in May, 2014. The Series covered the planning and surveillance systems used to monitor public health risks, public health threats, and experiences of health-care providers from mass gathering events in 2012 and 2013. This follow-up Review focuses on the main public health issues arising from planned mass gathering events held between 2013 and 2018. We highlight public health and research data on transmission of infectious diseases and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, mass casualty incidents, and non-communicable diseases, including thermal disorders. In the events discussed in this Review, the combination of a large influx of people, many from countries with outbreak-prone infectious diseases, with a high degree of crowd interactions imposed substantial burdens on host countries' health systems. The detection and transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in pilgrims attending the Kumbh Mela and the Hajj raise concern of possible globalisation from mass-gathering religious events. Priorities for further investments and opportunities for research into prevention, surveillance, and management of these public health issues are discussed.","[Memish, Ziad A.] Alfaisal Univ, Coll Med, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Memish, Ziad A.] Prince Mohamed Bin Abdulaziz Hosp, Minist Hlth, Dept Med & Res, Div Infect Dis, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Memish, Ziad A.] Emory Univ, Hubert Dept Global Hlth, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Steffen, Robert] Univ Zurich, Epidemiol Biostat & Prevent Inst, Zurich, Switzerland; [Steffen, Robert] Univ Texas Sch Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol Human Genet & Environm Sci, Houston, TX USA; [White, Paul] Commonwealth Hlth Care Corp, Commonwealth Northern Mariana Isl, Epidemiol & Lab Capac Program, Publ Hlth & Hosp Emergency Preparedness Program, Saipan, CM USA; [Dar, Osman] Publ Hlth England, London, England; [Dar, Osman] Royal Inst Int Affairs, Chatham House Ctr Global Hlth Secur, London, England; [Azhar, Esam I.] King Fahd Med Res Ctr, Infect Agents Unit, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Azhar, Esam I.] King Abdulaziz Univ, Med Lab Technol Dept, Fac Appl Med Sci, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Sharma, Avinash] Natl Ctr Microbial Resource, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Sharma, Avinash] Natl Ctr Cell Sci, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Zumla, Alimuddin] UCL, Div Infect, London, England; [Zumla, Alimuddin] Univ Coll London Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, NIHR Biomed Res Ctr, London, England",,"Zumla, A (corresponding author), UCL, Div Infect & Immun, London WC1E 6BT, England.",a.zumla@ucl.ac.uk,"Azhar, Esam/ABI-1044-2020; ZUMLA, Alimuddin/ABA-8208-2020; Memish, Ziad Ahmed/AEJ-9424-2022; Sharma, Avinash/AAD-9549-2020","ZUMLA, Alimuddin/0000-0002-5111-5735; Memish, Ziad Ahmed/0000-0002-5099-0714; Sharma, Avinash/0000-0001-9372-0178; Azhar, Esam/0000-0002-1736-181X","National Institutes of Health Research; European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership programme under Horizon 2020, the European Union's Framework Programme for Research and Innovation [RIA2016E-1609]","National Institutes of Health Research(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership programme under Horizon 2020, the European Union's Framework Programme for Research and Innovation","AZ is in receipt of a National Institutes of Health Research senior investigator award.

Health care personnel are often asked to assist affected passengers and the flight team, and many have limited experience in this environment. OBSERVATIONS In-flight medical emergencies are estimated to occur in approximately 1 per 604 flights, or 24 to 130 IMEs per 1 million passengers. These events happen in a unique environment, with airplane cabin pressurization equivalent to an altitude of 5000 to 8000 ft during flight, exposing patients to a low partial pressure of oxygen and low humidity. Minimum requirements for emergency medical kit equipment in the United States include an automated external defibrillator; equipment to obtain a basic assessment, hemorrhage control, and initiation of an intravenous line; and medications to treat basic conditions. Other countries have different minimum medical kit standards, and individual airlines have expanded the contents of their medical kit. The most common IMEs involve syncope or near-syncope (32.7%) and gastrointestinal (14.8%), respiratory (10.1%), and cardiovascular (7.0%) symptoms. Diversion of the aircraft from landing at the scheduled destination to a different airport because of a medical emergency occurs in an estimated 4.4%(95% CI, 4.3%-4.6%) of IMEs. Protections for medical volunteers who respond to IMEs in the United States include a Good Samaritan provision of the Aviation Medical Assistance Act and components of the Montreal Convention, although the duty to respond and legal protections vary across countries. Medical volunteers should identify their background and skills, perform an assessment, and report findings to ground-based medical support personnel through the flight crew. Ground-based recommendations ultimately guide interventions on board. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In-flight medical emergencies most commonly involve near-syncope and gastrointestinal, respiratory, and cardiovascular symptoms. Health care professionals can assist during these emergencies as part of a collaborative team involving the flight crew and ground-based physicians.","[Martin-Gill, Christian] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Emergency Med, 3600 Forbes Ave,Iroquois Bldg,Ste 400A, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Med Ctr, Pittsburgh, PA USA",,"Martin-Gill, C (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Emergency Med, 3600 Forbes Ave,Iroquois Bldg,Ste 400A, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA.",martingillc2@upmc.edu,,,,,,,90,33,33,3,12,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

The incidence of PDAC is increasing by 0.5% to 1.0% per year, and it is projected to become the second-leading cause of cancer-related mortality by 2030. ObservationsEffective screening is not available for PDAC, and most patients present with locally advanced (30%-35%) or metastatic (50%-55%) disease at diagnosis. A multidisciplinary management approach is recommended. Localized pancreas cancer includes resectable, borderline resectable (localized and involving major vascular structures), and locally advanced (unresectable) disease based on the degree of arterial and venous involvement by tumor, typically of the superior mesenteric vessels. For patients with resectable disease at presentation (10%-15%), surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX (fluorouracil, irinotecan, leucovorin, oxaliplatin) represents a standard therapeutic approach with an anticipated median overall survival of 54.4 months, compared with 35 months for single-agent gemcitabine (stratified hazard ratio for death, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.48-0.86]; P=.003). Neoadjuvant systemic therapy with or without radiation followed by evaluation for surgery is an accepted treatment approach for resectable and borderline resectable disease. For patients with locally advanced and unresectable disease due to extensive vascular involvement, systemic therapy followed by radiation is an option for definitive locoregional disease control. For patients with advanced (locally advanced and metastatic) PDAC, multiagent chemotherapy regimens, including FOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel, and nanoliposomal irinotecan/fluorouracil, all have a survival benefit of 2 to 6 months compared with a single-agent gemcitabine. For the 5% to 7% of patients with a BRCA pathogenic germline variant and metastatic PDAC, olaparib, a poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADB]-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, is a maintenance option that improves progression-free survival following initial platinum-based therapy. Conclusions and RelevanceApproximately 60000 new cases of PDAC are diagnosed per year, and approximately 50% of patients have advanced disease at diagnosis. The incidence of PDAC is increasing. Currently available cytotoxic therapies for advanced disease are modestly effective. For all patients, multidisciplinary management, comprehensive germline testing, and integrated supportive care are recommended. This review summarizes current evidence regarding pathobiology, diagnosis, and management of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","[Park, Wungki; O'Reilly, Eileen M.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Park, Wungki; O'Reilly, Eileen M.] David M Rubenstein Ctr Pancreat Canc Res, New York, NY USA; [Park, Wungki; O'Reilly, Eileen M.] Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Med, New York, NY USA; [Park, Wungki] Parker Inst Canc Immunotherapy, San Francisco, CA USA; [Chawla, Akhil] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Surg, Northwestern Med Reg Med Grp, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Chawla, Akhil] Robert H Lurie Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chicago, IL USA",,"O'Reilly, EM (corresponding author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, 300 E 66th St,Off 1021, New York, NY 10065 USA.",oreillye@mskcc.org,,,,,,,90,60,61,26,39,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

OBJECTIVE To review the evidence on screening for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with electrocardiography (ECG) and stroke prevention treatment in asymptomatic adults 65 years or older to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries through May 2017; references; experts; literature surveillance through June 6, 2018. STUDY SELECTION English-language randomized clinical trials (RCTs), prospective cohort studies evaluating detection rates of atrial fibrillation or harms of screening, and systematic reviews evaluating stroke prevention treatment. Eligible treatment studies compared warfarin, aspirin, or novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) with placebo or no treatment. Studies were excluded that focused on persons with a history of cardiovascular disease. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality. When at least 3 similar studies were available, random-effects meta-analyses were conducted. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Detection of previously undiagnosed atrial fibrillation, mortality, stroke, stroke-related morbidity, and harms. RESULTS Seventeen studies were included (n = 135 300). No studies evaluated screening compared with no screening and focused on health outcomes. Systematic screening with ECG identified more new cases of atrial fibrillation than no screening (absolute increase, from 0.6%[95% CI, 0.1%-0.9%] to 2.8%[95% CI, 0.9%-4.7%] over 12 months; 2 RCTs, n = 15 803), but a systematic approach using ECG did not detect more cases than an approach using pulse palpation (2 RCTs, n = 17 803). For potential harms, no eligible studies compared screening with no screening. Warfarin (mean, 1.5 years) was associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke (relative risk [RR], 0.32 [95% CI, 0.20-0.51]) and all-cause mortality (RR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.50-0.93]) and with increased risk of bleeding (5 trials, n = 2415). Participants in treatment trials were not screen detected, and most had long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation. A network meta-analysis reported that NOACs were associated with a significantly lower risk of a composite outcome of stroke and systemic embolism (adjusted odds ratios compared with placebo or control ranged from 0.32-0.44); the risk of bleeding was increased (adjusted odds ratios, 1.4-2.2), but confidence intervals were wide and differences between groups were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although screening with ECG can detect previously unknown cases of atrial fibrillation, it has not been shown to detect more cases than screening focused on pulse palpation. Treatments for atrial fibrillation reduce the risk of stroke and all-cause mortality and increase the risk of bleeding, but trials have not assessed whether treatment of screen-detected asymptomatic older adults results in better health outcomes than treatment after detection by usual care or after symptoms develop.","[Jonas, Daniel E.; Kahwati, Leila C.; Middleton, Jennifer Cook; Coker-Schwimmer, Manny] Int Univ North Carolina, Chapel Hill Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Jonas, Daniel E.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Med, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Jonas, Daniel E.; Yun, Jonathan D.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Invasive cervical cancer; cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN); false-positive, colposcopy, and biopsy rates; psychological harms. RESULTS Eight RCTs (n = 410 556), 5 cohort studies (n = 402 615), and 1 individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis (n = 176 464) were included. Trials were heterogeneous for screening interval, number of rounds, and protocol. For primary hrHPV screening, evidence was consistent across 4 trials demonstrating increased detection of CIN 3 or worse (CIN 3+) in round 1 (relative risk [RR] range, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.09-2.37] to 7.46 [95% CI, 1.02-54.66]). Among 4 hrHPV cotesting trials, first-round CIN 3+ detection was not significantly different between screening groups; RRs for cumulative CIN 3+ detection over 2 screening rounds ranged from 0.91 to 1.13. In first-round screening, false-positive rates for primary hrHPV screening ranged from 6.6% to 7.4%, compared with 2.6% to 6.5% for cytology. For cotesting, false-positives ranged from 5.8% to 19.9% in the first round of screening, compared with 2.6% to 10.9% for cytology. First-round colposcopy rates were also higher, ranging 1.2% to 7.9% for primary hrHPV testing, compared with 1.1% to 3.1% for cytology alone; colposcopy rates for cotesting ranged from 6.8% to 10.9%, compared with 3.3% to 5.2% for cytology alone. The IPD meta-analysis of data from 4 cotesting trials and 1 primary hrHPV screening trial found lower risk of invasive cervical cancer with any hrHPV screening compared with cytology alone (pooled RR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.40-0.89]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Primary hrHPV screening detected higher rates of CIN 3+ at first-round screening compared with cytology. Cotesting trials did not show initial increased CIN 3+ detection. Both hrHPV screening strategies had higher false-positive and colposcopy rates than cytology, which could lead to more treatments with potential harms.","[Melnikow, Joy; Durbin, Shauna; Weyrich, Meghan S.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Healthcare Policy & Res, 4860 Y St,Ste 2300, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA; [Henderson, Jillian T.; Burda, Brittany U.; Senger, Caitlyn A.] Kaiser Permanente, Res Affiliates Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Ctr Hlth Res, Portland, OR USA",,"Melnikow, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Healthcare Policy & Res, 4860 Y St,Ste 2300, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA.",jamelnikow@ucdavis.edu,,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA-290-2012-00015-I]; USPSTF","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services; USPSTF","This research was funded under contract HHSA-290-2012-00015-I, Task Order 6, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the USPSTF.",,60,102,108,0,6,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

More than 95% of ovarian cancer deaths occur among women 45 years and older. OBJECTIVE To update the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for ovarian cancer. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women not known to be at high risk for ovarian cancer (ie, high risk includes women with certain hereditary cancer syndromes that increase their risk for ovarian cancer). Outcomes of interest included ovarian cancer mortality, quality of life, false-positive rate, surgery and surgical complication rates, and psychological effects of screening. FINDINGS The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for ovarian cancer does not reduce ovarian cancer mortality. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms from screening for ovarian cancer are at least moderate and may be substantial in some cases, and include unnecessary surgery for women who do not have cancer. Given the lack of mortality benefit of screening, and the moderate to substantial harms that could result from false-positive screening test results and subsequent surgery, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of screening for ovarian cancer outweigh the benefit, and the net balance of the benefit and harms of screening is negative. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF recommends against screening for ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women. (D recommendation) This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women who are not known to have a high-risk hereditary cancer syndrome.","[Grossman, David C.] Kaiser Permanente, Washington Hlth Res Inst, Seattle, WA 98101 USA; [Curry, Susan J.] Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA USA; [Owens, Douglas K.] Vet Affairs Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Palo Alto, CA USA; [Owens, Douglas K.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Barry, Michael J.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA USA; [Davidson, Karina W.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA; [Doubeni, Chyke A.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Epling, John W., Jr.] Virginia Tech, Caril Sch Med, Roanoke, VA USA; [Kemper, Alex R.] Nationwide Childrens Hosp, Columbus, OH USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Fairfax Family Practice Residency, Fairfax, VA USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, VA USA; [Kurth, Ann E.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT USA; [Landefeld, Seth] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL USA; [Mangione, Carol M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Phipps, Maureen G.] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Silverstein, Michael] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Simon, Melissa A.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Univ Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Pacific Hlth Res & Educ Inst, Honolulu, HI USA",,"Grossman, DC (corresponding author), Kaiser Permanente, Washington Hlth Res Inst, Seattle, WA 98101 USA.",chair@uspstf.net,"Epling, John W/J-1097-2019; Davidson, Karina/AAG-2388-2019","Epling, John W/0000-0001-9445-8669; Davidson, Karina/0000-0002-9162-477X; Kemper, Alex/0000-0001-5491-3997",Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ); NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE [P30CA086862] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality); NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)),"The USPSTF is an independent, voluntary body.

Three different oral CDK4/6 inhibitors, palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib, have significantly improved progression-free survival by a number of months when combined with endocrine therapy. More recently, improvement in overall survival has been reported with ribociclib and abemaciclib. The toxicity profile of all three drugs is well described and generally easily manageable with dose reductions when indicated. More myelotoxicity is observed with palbociclib and ribociclib, but more gastrointestinal toxicity is observed with abemaciclib. Emerging data is shedding light on the resistance mechanisms associated with CDK4/6 inhibitors, including cell cycle alterations and activation of upstream tyrosine kinase receptors. A number of clinical trials are exploring several important questions regarding treatment sequencing, combinatorial strategies, and the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings, thereby further expanding and refining the clinical application of CDK4/6 inhibitors for patients with breast cancer.","[Spring, Laura M.; Wander, Seth A.; Moy, Beverly; Bardia, Aditya] Harvard Med Sch, Massachusetts Gen Hosp Canc Ctr, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Andre, Fabrice] Inst Gustave Roussy, Dept Med Oncol, Villejuif, France; [Turner, Nicholas C.] Royal Marsden Hosp, Inst Canc Res, Dept Med Oncol, London, England",,"Bardia, A (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Massachusetts Gen Hosp Canc Ctr, Dept Med Oncol, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",bardia.aditya@mgh.harvard.edu,"ANDRE, Fabrice/AAL-2683-2020","ANDRE, Fabrice/0000-0001-5795-8357; Turner, Nicholas/0000-0001-8937-0873; Wander, Seth/0000-0002-4127-4708",National Cancer Institute [KL2 TR002542]; Terri Brodeur Breast Cancer Foundation; Massachusetts General Hospital Electronic Space Systems Corporation Breast Cancer Research Fund grant,National Cancer Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); Terri Brodeur Breast Cancer Foundation; Massachusetts General Hospital Electronic Space Systems Corporation Breast Cancer Research Fund grant,"LMS is supported by National Cancer Institute grant KL2 TR002542, a Terri Brodeur Breast Cancer Foundation grant, and a Massachusetts General Hospital Electronic Space Systems Corporation Breast Cancer Research Fund grant.",,81,117,123,9,53,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,MAR 7,2020,395,10226,,,,,817,827,,,,,,11,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,KU2KH,32145796,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000519536900039,View Full Record in Web of Science,60202,0,36,59,13,66,32,27,8,57,61,68,26,43,64,62,74

From 2006 to 2010, an estimated 88 000 alcohol-attributable deaths occurred annually in the United States, caused by both acute conditions (eg, injuries from motor vehicle collisions) and chronic conditions (eg, alcoholic liver disease). Alcohol use during pregnancy is also one of the major preventable causes of birth defects and developmental disabilities. OBJECTIVE To update the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2013 recommendation on screening for unhealthy alcohol use in primary care settings. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on the effectiveness of screening to reduce unhealthy alcohol use (defined as a spectrum of behaviors, from risky drinking to alcohol use disorder, that result in increased risk for health consequences) morbidity, mortality, or risky behaviors and to improve health, social, or legal outcomes; the accuracy of various screening approaches; the effectiveness of counseling interventions to reduce unhealthy alcohol use, morbidity, mortality, or risky behaviors and to improve health, social, or legal outcomes; and the harms of screening and behavioral counseling interventions. FINDINGS The net benefit of screening and brief behavioral counseling interventions for unhealthy alcohol use in adults, including pregnant women, is moderate. The evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening and brief behavioral counseling interventions for unhealthy alcohol use in adolescents. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF recommends screening for unhealthy alcohol use in primary care settings in adults 18 years or older, including pregnant women, and providing persons engaged in risky or hazardous drinking with brief behavioral counseling interventions to reduce unhealthy alcohol use. (B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening and brief behavioral counseling interventions for alcohol use in primary care settings in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years.

We aimed to investigate the effects of physical distance, face masks, and eye protection on virus transmission in health-care and non-health-care (eg, community) settings. Methods We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the optimum distance for avoiding person-to-person virus transmission and to assess the use of face masks and eye protection to prevent transmission of viruses. We obtained data for SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Middle East respiratory syndrome from 21 standard WHO-specific and COVID-19-specific sources. We searched these data sources from database inception to May 3, 2020, with no restriction by language, for comparative studies and for contextual factors of acceptability, feasibility, resource use, and equity. We screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in duplicate. We did frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses and random-effects meta-regressions. We rated the certainty of evidence according to Cochrane methods and the GRADE approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020177047. Findings Our search identified 172 observational studies across 16 countries and six continents, with no randomised controlled trials and 44 relevant comparative studies in health-care and non-health-care settings (n=25 697 patients). Transmission of viruses was lower with physical distancing of 1 m or more, compared with a distance of less than 1 m (n=10 736, pooled adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.18, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.38; risk difference [RD]-10.2%, 95% CI -11.5 to-7.5; moderate certainty); protection was increased as distance was lengthened (change in relative risk [RR] 2.02 per m; p(interaction)=0.041; moderate certainty). Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection (n=2647; aOR 0.15, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.34, RD-14.3%,-15.9 to-10.7; low certainty), with stronger associations with N95 or similar respirators compared with disposable surgical masks or similar (eg, reusable 12-16-layer cotton masks; p(interaction)=0.090; posterior probability >95%, low certainty). Eye protection also was associated with less infection (n=3713; aOR 0.22, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.39, RD-10.6%, 95% CI-12.5 to -7.7; low certainty). Unadjusted studies and subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed similar findings. Interpretation The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis support physical distancing of 1 m or more and provide quantitative estimates for models and contact tracing to inform policy. Optimum use of face masks, respirators, and eye protection in public and health-care settings should be informed by these findings and contextual factors. Robust randomised trials are needed to better inform the evidence for these interventions, but this systematic appraisal of currently best available evidence might inform interim guidance.

The journey from diagnosis of miscarriage, through clinical management, to supportive aftercare can be challenging for women, their partners, and caregivers. Diagnostic challenges can lead to delayed or ineffective care and increased anxiety. Inaccurate diagnosis of a miscarriage can result in the unintended termination of a wanted pregnancy. Uncertainty about the therapeutic effects of interventions can lead to suboptimal care, with variations across facilities and countries. For this Series paper, we have developed recommendations for practice from a literature review, appraisal of guidelines, and expert group discussions. The recommendations are grouped into three categories: (1) diagnosis of miscarriage, (2) prevention of miscarriage in women with early pregnancy bleeding, and (3) management of miscarriage. We recommend that every country reports annual aggregate miscarriage data, similarly to the reporting of stillbirth. Early pregnancy services need to focus on providing an effective ultrasound service, as it is central to the diagnosis of miscarriage, and be able to provide expectant management of miscarriage, medical management with mifepristone and misoprostol, and surgical management with manual vacuum aspiration. Women with the dual risk factors of early pregnancy bleeding and a history of previous miscarriage can be recommended vaginal micronised progesterone to improve the prospects of livebirth. We urge health-care funders and providers to invest in early pregnancy care, with specific focus on training for clinical nurse specialists and doctors to provide comprehensive miscarriage care within the setting of dedicated early pregnancy units.","[Coomarasamy, Arri; Gallos, Ioannis D.; Papadopoulou, Argyro; Dhillon-Smith, Rima K.; Devall, Adam J.] Univ Birmingham, Inst Metab & Syst Res, Tommys Natl Ctr Miscarriage Res, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Al-Memar, Maya; Bennett, Phillip R.; Regan, Lesley; Bourne, Tom] Imperial Coll London, Tommys Natl Ctr Miscarriage Res, London, England; [Brewin, Jane] Tommys Char, Laurence Pountney Hill, London, England; [Christiansen, Ole B.] Aalborg Univ Hosp, Dept Obstet & Gynaecol, Ctr Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Western Denmark, Aalborg, Denmark; [Stephenson, Mary D.] Univ Illinois, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Program, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Oladapo, Olufemi T.] WHO, Dept Sexual & Reprod Hlth & Res, UNDP UNFPA UNICEF WHO World Bank Special Programm, Geneva, Switzerland; [Wijeyaratne, Chandrika N.] Univ Colombo, Dept Reprod Med, Colombo, Sri Lanka; [Small, Rachel] Univ Hosp Birmingham NHS Fdn Trust, Birmingham Heartlands Hosp, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Goddijn, Mariette] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, Ctr Reprod Med, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bourne, Tom] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Dev & Regenerat, Leuven, Belgium; [Brosens, Jan J.; Quenby, Siobhan] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Div Biomed Sci, Warwick, England; [Brosens, Jan J.; Quenby, Siobhan] Univ Hosp Coventry & Warwickshire NHS Trust, Tommys Natl Ctr Miscarriage Res, Coventry, W Midlands, England",,"Gallos, ID (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Inst Metab & Syst Res, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",i.d.gallos@bham.ac.uk,"Bourne, Tom/I-6478-2012; Devall, Adam/AAC-9646-2022; Papadopoulou, Argyro/AAR-1380-2020","Bourne, Tom/0000-0003-1421-6059; Papadopoulou, Argyro/0000-0001-9409-8608; Bennett, Phillip/0000-0002-6253-4919; Quenby, Siobhan/0000-0003-3221-5471; Goddijn, Mariette/0000-0001-9928-9673; Gallos, Ioannis/0000-0002-2766-358X",Tommy's Charity; Wellcome Trust Investigator Award [212233/Z/18/Z],Tommy's Charity; Wellcome Trust Investigator Award(Wellcome Trust),"The Tommy's Charity funds the Tommy's National Centre for Miscarriage Research.

Vitamin D requirements may vary by individual; thus, no one serum vitamin D level cutpoint defines deficiency, and no consensus exists regarding the precise serum levels of vitamin D that represent optimal health or sufficiency. ObjectiveTo update its 2014 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on screening for vitamin D deficiency, including the benefits and harms of screening and early treatment. PopulationCommunity-dwelling, nonpregnant adults who have no signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended. Evidence AssessmentThe USPSTF concludes that the overall evidence on the benefits of screening for vitamin D deficiency is lacking. Therefore, the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined. RecommendationThe USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults.

STUDY SELECTION English-language fair-and good-quality randomized clinical trials that (1) included children with no known exposure to maltreatment and no signs or symptoms of current or past maltreatment, (2) evaluated interventions feasible in a primary care setting or that could result from a referral from primary care, and (3) reported abuse or neglect outcomes or proxies for abuse or neglect (eg, injury with a specificity for abuse, visits to the emergency department, hospitalization). DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers independently assessed titles/abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality; a third resolved conflicts when needed. When at least 3 similar trials were available, random-effects meta-analyses were conducted. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Direct measures (including reports to child protective services and removal of the child from the home) or proxy measures of abuse or neglect; behavioral, emotional, mental, or physical well-being; and harms. RESULTS Twenty-two trials (33 publications) were included (N = 11 132). No significant association was found between interventions and reports to child protective services within 1 year of intervention completion (10.6% vs 11.9%; pooled odds ratio [OR], 0.94 [95% CI, 0.72-1.23]; 10 trials [n = 2444]) or removal of the child from the home within 1 to 3 years of follow-up (3.5% vs 3.7%; pooled OR, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.16-7.28]; 4 trials [n = 609]). No statistically significant associations were observed between interventions and outcomes for emergency department visits in the short term (< 2 years), hospitalizations, child development, school performance, and prevention of death. Nonsignificant results from single trials led to a conclusion of insufficient evidence for injuries, failure to thrive, failure to immunize, school attendance, and other measures of abuse or neglect. Inconsistent results led to a conclusion of insufficient evidence for long-term (< 2 years) outcomes for reports to child protective services (ORs range from 0.48 to 1.13; 3 trials [n = 1690]), emergency department visits (1 of 2 trials reported significant differences) and internalizing and externalizing behavior symptoms (3 of 6 trials reported reductions in behavior difficulties). No eligible trials on harms of interventions were identified. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Interventions provided in or referable from primary care did not consistently prevent child maltreatment. No evidence on harms is available.","[Viswanathan, Meera; Pan, Huiling; Forman-Hoffman, Valerie L.; Lohr, Kathleen N.; Patel, Sheila; Jonas, Daniel E.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, RTI Int, Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Viswanathan, Meera; Pan, Huiling; Forman-Hoffman, Valerie L.; Patel, Sheila] RTI Int, 3040 E Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Fraser, Jenifer Goldman] ZERO THREE, Washington, DC USA; [Morgenlander, Marcia; Zolotor, Adam J.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Family Med, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [McKeeman, Joni L.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Psychiat, Sch Med, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Hart, Laura C.] Nationwide Childrens Hosp, Columbus, OH USA; [Hart, Laura C.; Jonas, Daniel E.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Cecil G Sheps Ctr Hlth Serv Res, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Jonas, Daniel E.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Med, Chapel Hill, NC USA",,"Viswanathan, M (corresponding author), RTI Int, 3040 E Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",viswanathan@rti.org,,"Zolotor, Adam/0000-0002-9007-223X; Lohr, Kathleen/0000-0002-3825-0713; Patel, Sheila/0000-0002-6508-8803","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA-290-2015-0001-I, 5]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA-290-2015-0001-I, Task Order 5, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the USPSTF.",,51,10,10,1,13,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

To achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, the rate of decline in prevalence of maternal and child mortality, stillbirths, and stunting among children younger than 5 years of age needs to accelerate considerably compared with progress since 2000. Such accelerations are only possible with a rapid scale-up of effective interventions to all population groups within countries (particularly in countries with the highest mortality and in those affected by conflict), supported by improvements in underlying socioeconomic conditions, including women's empowerment. Three main conclusions emerge from our analysis of intervention coverage, equity, and drivers of reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health (RMNCH) in the 81 Countdown countries. First, even though strong progress was made in the coverage of many essential RMNCH interventions during the past decade, many countries are still a long way from universal coverage for most essential interventions. Furthermore, a growing body of evidence suggests that available services in many countries are of poor quality, limiting the potential effect on RMNCH outcomes. Second, within-country inequalities in intervention coverage are reducing in most countries (and are now almost non-existent in a few countries), but the pace is too slow. Third, health-sector (eg, weak country health systems) and non-health-sector drivers (eg, conflict settings) are major impediments to delivering high-quality services to all populations. Although more data for RMNCH interventions are available now, major data gaps still preclude the use of evidence to drive decision making and accountability. Countdown to 2030 is investing in improvements in measurement in several areas, such as quality of care and effective coverage, nutrition programmes, adolescent health, early childhood development, and evidence for conflict settings, and is prioritising its regional networks to enhance local analytic capacity and evidence for RMNCH.","[Boerma, Ties] Univ Manitoba, Rady Fac Hlth Sci, Ctr Global Publ Hlth, 771 McDermot Ave, Winnipeg, MB R3E 0T6, Canada; [Boerma, Ties] Univ Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Requejo, Jennifer; Amouzou, Agbessi; Black, Robert E.; Chu, Yue; Fox, Monica; Jiwani, Safia; Keita, Youssouf; Park, Lois A.; Spiegel, Paul; Tappis, Hannah; Weiss, William] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Victora, Cesar G.; Barros, Aluisio J.

Volume 9, Improving Health and Reducing Poverty, summarises the main messages from all the volumes and contains cross-cutting analyses. This Review draws on all nine volumes to convey conclusions. The analysis in DCP3 is built around 21 essential packages that were developed in the nine volumes. Each essential package addresses the concerns of a major professional community (eg, child health or surgery) and contains a mix of intersectoral policies and health-sector interventions. 71 intersectoral prevention policies were identified in total, 29 of which are priorities for early introduction. Interventions within the health sector were grouped onto five platforms (population based, community level, health centre, first-level hospital, and referral hospital). DCP3 defines a model concept of essential universal health coverage (EUHC) with 218 interventions that provides a starting point for country-specific analysis of priorities. Assuming steady-state implementation by 2030, EUHC in lower-middle-income countries would reduce premature deaths by an estimated 4.2 million per year. Estimated total costs prove substantial: about 9.1% of (current) gross national income (GNI) in low-income countries and 5.2% of GNI in lower-middle-income countries. Financing provision of continuing intervention against chronic conditions accounts for about half of estimated incremental costs. For lower-middle-income countries, the mortality reduction from implementing the EUHC can only reach about half the mortality reduction in non-communicable diseases called for by the Sustainable Development Goals. Full achievement will require increased investment or sustained intersectoral action, and actions by finance ministries to tax smoking and polluting emissions and to reduce or eliminate (often large) subsidies on fossil fuels appear of central importance. DCP3 is intended to be a model starting point for analyses at the country level, but country-specific cost structures, epidemiological needs, and national priorities will generally lead to definitions of EUHC that differ from country to country and from the model in this Review. DCP3 is particularly relevant as achievement of EUHC relies increasingly on greater domestic finance, with global developmental assistance in health focusing more on global public goods. In addition to assessing effects on mortality, DCP3 looked at outcomes of EUHC not encompassed by the disability-adjusted life-year metric and related cost-effectiveness analyses. The other objectives included financial protection (potentially better provided upstream by keeping people out of the hospital rather than downstream by paying their hospital bills for them), stillbirths averted, palliative care, contraception, and child physical and intellectual growth. The first 1000 days after conception are highly important for child development, but the next 7000 days are likewise important and often neglected.","[Jamison, Dean T.; Debas, Haile T.; Peabody, John; Sepulveda, Jaime] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Alwan, Ala; Mock, Charles N.; Watkins, David; Brouwer, Elizabeth; Danforth, Kristen; Holmes, King K.; Levin, Carol] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Nugent, Rachel] RTI Int, Seattle, WA USA; [Adeyi, Olusoji; Measham, Anthony] World Bank Grp, Washington, DC USA; [Anand, Shuchi; Cullen, Mark] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Atun, Rifat; Bloom, Barry R.; Gawande, Atul; Kruk, Margaret E.; Verguet, Stephane] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA USA; [Bertozzi, Stefano; Olson, Zachary; Smith, Kirk R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bhutta, Zulfiqar] Aga Khan Univ, Karachi, Pakistan; [Binagwaho, Agnes; Gawande, Atul; Gaziano, Thomas; Krakauer, Eric L.; Patel, Vikram] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA USA; [Black, Robert; Walker, Neff] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Blecher, Mark] Natl Treasury South Africa, Cape Town, South Africa; [Bundy, Donald A.

Evidence about its non-inferiority in comparison with ABO-compatible renal transplantation (ABOc-rTx) needs to be analysed at early and late timepoints. We aimed to investigate differences in outcome after ABOi-rTX and ABOc-rTX. Methods We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies published up until Dec 31, 2017, that reported outcome data (>= 1 year of follow-up) after ABOi-rTx and included an ABO-compatible control group, by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase Ovid, MEDLINE Ovid, and PubMed. Trials on recipients of ABOi-rTx were assessed, if an ABO-compatible control group was included and if outcome data on at least graft or recipient survival with 1 year or more of follow-up were available. Exclusion criteria included case reports, editorials, reviews and letters, animal studies, meeting papers, studies unable to extract data, non-renal solid organ and bone-marrow transplant studies, and deceased donor ABOc-rTx. Data were extracted from published reports. Primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and graft survival at 1, 3, 5, and more than 8 years after transplantation. In the meta-analysis, we used a fixed-effects model if the I (2) value was 0, and both a fixed-effects and random-effects model if I-2 was more than 0. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018094550. Findings 1264 studies were screened and 40 studies including 49 patient groups were identified. 65 063 patients were eligible for analysis, 7098 of whom had undergone ABOi-rTx. Compared with ABOc-rTx, ABOi-rTx was associated with significantly higher 1-year mortality (odds ratio [OR] 2.17 [95% CI 1.63-2.90], p<0.0001; I-2=37%), 3 years (OR 1.89 [1.46-2.45], p<0.0001; I-2=29%), and 5 years (OR 1.47 [1.08-2.00], p=0.010; I-2=68%) following transplantation. Death-censored graft survival was lower with ABOi-rTx than with ABOc-rTx at 1 year (OR 2.52 [1.80-3.54], p<0.0001; I-2=61%) and 3 years (OR 1.59 [1.15-2.18], p=0.0040; I-2=58%) only. Graft losses were equivalent to that of ABOc-rTx after 5 years and patient survival after 8 years. No publication bias was detected and the results were robust to trial sequential analysis until 5 years after transplantation; thereafter, data became futile or inconclusive. Interpretation Despite progress in desensitisation protocols and optimisation of ABOi-rTx procedures, excess mortality and loss of kidney grafts was found compared with ABOc-rTx within the first 3 years after transplantation. Only long-term outcomes after 5 years yielded equivalent survival rates and organ function. Awareness of the increased risks of infection, organ rejection, and bleeding could improve care of patients and promote efforts towards paired kidney exchange programmes.

Acute cholecystitis is diagnosed in approximately 200000 people in the US each year. OBSERVATIONS Gallstone-associated cystic duct obstruction is responsible for 90% to 95% of the cases of acute cholecystitis. Approximately 5% to 10% of patients with acute cholecystitis have acalculous cholecystitis, defined as acute inflammation of the gallbladder without gallstones, typically in the setting of severe critical illness. The typical presentation of acute cholecystitis consists of acute right upper quadrant pain, fever, and nausea that may be associated with eating and physical examination findings of right upper quadrant tenderness. Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant has a sensitivity of approximately 81% and a specificity of approximately 83% for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. When an ultrasound result does not provide a definitive diagnosis, hepatobiliary scintigraphy (a nuclear medicine study that includes the intravenous injection of a radiotracer excreted in the bile) is the gold standard diagnostic test. Following diagnosis, early (performed within 1-3 days) vs late (performed after 3 days) laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with improved patient outcomes, including fewer composite postoperative complications (11.8% for early vs 34.4% for late), a shorter length of hospital stay (5.4 days vs 10.0 days), and lower hospital costs. During pregnancy, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy, compared with delayed operative management, is associated with a lower risk of maternal-fetal complications (1.6% for early vs 18.4% for delayed) and is recommended during all trimesters. In people older than 65 years of age, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with lower mortality at 2-year follow-up (15.2%) compared with nonoperative management (29.3%). A percutaneous cholecystostomy tube, in which a drainage catheter is placed in the gallbladder lumen under image guidance, is an effective therapy for patients with an exceptionally high perioperative risk. However, percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement in a randomized trial was associated with higher rates of postprocedural complications (65%) compared with laparoscopic cholecystectomy (12%). For patients with acalculous acute cholecystitis, percutaneous cholecystostomy tube should be reserved for patients who are severely ill at the time of diagnosis; all others should undergo a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. CONCLUSIONS and RelevanceAcute cholecystitis, typically due to gallstone obstruction of the cystic duct, affects approximately 200000 people in the US annually. In most patient populations, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, performed within 3 days of diagnosis, is the first-line therapy for acute cholecystitis.","[Gallaher, Jared R.; Charles, Anthony] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA",,"Charles, A (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Surg, 4008 Burnett Womack Bldg,CB 7228, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",anthony_charles@med.unc.edu,,,,,,,101,0,0,8,8,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

In addition to the immediate effects of IPV, such as injury and death, there are other health consequences, many with long-term effects, including development of mental health conditions such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and suicidal behavior; sexually transmitted infections; unintended pregnancy; and chronic pain and other disabilities. Long-term negative health effects from elder abuse include death, higher risk of nursing home placement, and adverse psychological consequences. OBJECTIVE To update the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2013 recommendation on screening for IPV, elder abuse, and abuse of vulnerable adults. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on screening for IPV in adolescents, women, and men; for elder abuse; and for abuse of vulnerable adults. FINDINGS The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for IPV in women of reproductive age and providing or referring women who screen positive to ongoing support services has a moderate net benefit. There is adequate evidence that available screening instruments can identify IPV in women. The evidence does not support the effectiveness of brief interventions or the provision of information about referral options in the absence of ongoing supportive intervention components. The evidence demonstrating benefit of ongoing support services is predominantly found in studies of pregnant or postpartum women. The benefits and harms of screening for elder abuse and abuse of vulnerable adults are uncertain, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen for IPV in women of reproductive age and provide or refer women who screen positive to ongoing support services. (B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for abuse and neglect in all older or vulnerable adults.

Cardiac involvement during acute rheumatic fever can result in rheumatic heart disease, which can cause heart failure and premature mortality. Poverty and household overcrowding are associated with an increased prevalence of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, both of which remain a public health problem in many low-income countries. Control efforts are hampered by the scarcity of accurate data on disease burden, and effective approaches to diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. The diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever is entirely clinical, without any laboratory gold standard, and no treatments have been shown to reduce progression to rheumatic heart disease. Prevention mainly relies on the prompt recognition and treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis, and avoidance of recurrent infection using long-term antibiotics. But evidence for the effectiveness of either approach is not strong.

The elements comprising the lumbar spine (eg, soft tissue, vertebrae, zygapophyseal and sacroiliac joints, intervertebral discs, and neurovascular structures) are prone to different stressors, and each of these, alone or in combination, can contribute to low back pain. Due to numerous factors related to low back pain, and the low specificity of imaging and diagnostic injections, diagnostic methods for this condition continue to be a subject of controversy. The biopsychosocial model posits low back pain to be a dynamic interaction between social, psychological, and biological factors that can both predispose to and result from injury, and should be considered when devising interdisciplinary treatment plans. Prevention of low back pain is recognised as a pivotal challenge in high-risk populations to help tackle high health-care costs related to therapy and rehabilitation. To a large extent, therapy depends on pain classification, and usually starts with self-care and pharmacotherapy in combination with non-pharmacological methods, such as physical therapies and psychological treatments in appropriate patients. For refractory low back pain, a wide range of non-surgical (eg, epidural steroid injections and spinal cord stimulation for neuropathic pain, and radiofrequency ablation and intra-articular steroid injections for mechanical pain) and surgical (eg, decompression for neuropathic pain, disc replacement, and fusion for mechanical causes) treatment options are available in carefully selected patients. Most treatment options address only single, solitary causes and given the complex nature of low back pain, a multimodal interdisciplinary approach is necessary. Although globally recognised as an important health and socioeconomic challenge with an expected increase in prevalence, low back pain continues to have tremendous potential for improvement in both diagnostic and therapeutic aspects. Future research on low back pain should focus on improving the accuracy and objectivity of diagnostic assessments, and devising treatment algorithms that consider unique biological, psychological, and social factors. High-quality comparative-effectiveness and randomised controlled trials with longer follow-up periods that aim to establish the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of low back pain management are warranted.","[Knezevic, Nebojsa Nick; Candido, Kenneth D.] Advocate Illinois Masonic Med Ctr, Dept Anesthesiol, Chicago, IL 60657 USA; [Knezevic, Nebojsa Nick; Candido, Kenneth D.] Univ Illinois, Dept Anesthesiol, Chicago, IL USA; [Knezevic, Nebojsa Nick; Candido, Kenneth D.] Univ Illinois, Dept Surg, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Vlaeyen, Johan W.

Lessons learned from the development of these agents can accelerate the development of next-generation inhibitors to optimise the therapeutic index, overcome drug resistance, and establish combination therapies.

ObjectiveTo review the evidence on screening for prediabetes and diabetes to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Data SourcesPubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries through September 2019; references; and experts; literature surveillance through May 21, 2021. Study SelectionEnglish-language controlled studies evaluating screening or interventions for prediabetes or diabetes that was screen detected or recently diagnosed. Data Extraction and SynthesisDual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality; qualitative synthesis of findings; meta-analyses conducted when at least 3 similar studies were available. Main Outcomes and MeasuresMortality, cardiovascular morbidity, diabetes-related morbidity, development of diabetes, quality of life, and harms. ResultsThe review included 89 publications (N=68882). Two randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (25120 participants) found no significant difference between screening and control groups for all-cause or cause-specific mortality at 10 years. For harms (eg, anxiety or worry), the trials reported no significant differences between screening and control groups. For recently diagnosed (not screen-detected) diabetes, 5 RCTs (5138 participants) were included. In the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, health outcomes were improved with intensive glucose control with sulfonylureas or insulin. For example, for all-cause mortality the relative risk (RR) was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.79 to 0.96) over 20 years (10-year posttrial assessment). For overweight persons, intensive glucose control with metformin improved health outcomes at the 10-year follow-up (eg, all-cause mortality: RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.91]), and benefits were maintained longer term. Lifestyle interventions (most involving >360 minutes) for obese or overweight persons with prediabetes were associated with reductions in the incidence of diabetes (23 RCTs; pooled RR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.69 to 0.88]). Lifestyle interventions were also associated with improved intermediate outcomes, such as reduced weight, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure (pooled weighted mean difference, -1.7 mm Hg [95% CI, -2.6 to -0.8] and -1.2 mm Hg [95% CI, -2.0 to -0.4], respectively). Metformin was associated with a significant reduction in diabetes incidence (pooled RR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.64 to 0.83]) and reduction in weight and body mass index. Conclusions and RelevanceTrials of screening for diabetes found no significant mortality benefit but had insufficient data to assess other health outcomes; evidence on harms of screening was limited. For persons with recently diagnosed (not screen-detected) diabetes, interventions improved health outcomes; for obese or overweight persons with prediabetes, interventions were associated with reduced incidence of diabetes and improvement in other intermediate outcomes. This systematic review to support the 2021 US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement on screening for diabetes summarizes published evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic persons.","[Jonas, Daniel E.; Crotty, Karen; Middleton, Jennifer Cook; Feltner, Cynthia; Barclay, Colleen; Baker, Claire; Voisin, Christiane E.] Univ N Carolina, Evidence Based Practice Ctr, RTI Int, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Jonas, Daniel E.; Barclay, Colleen] Ohio State Univ, Dept Internal Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Crotty, Karen] RTI Int, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Yun, Jonathan D.

An estimated 0.7-1 million new cases of leishmaniasis per year are reported from nearly 100 endemic countries. The number of reported visceral leishmaniasis cases has decreased substantially in the past decade as a result of better access to diagnosis and treatment and more intense vector control within an elimination initiative in Asia, although natural cycles in transmission intensity might play a role. In east Africa however, the case numbers of this fatal disease continue to be sustained. Increased conflict in endemic areas of cutaneous leishmaniasis and forced displacement has resulted in a surge in these endemic areas as well as clinics across the world.

Opioid overdose death rates have increased steadily for more than a decade and doubled in 2013-17, as the highly potent synthetic opioid fentanyl entered the drug supply. Demographics of new HIV diagnoses among people who inject drugs are also changing, with more new HIV diagnoses occurring among White people, young people (aged 13-34 years), and people who reside outside large central metropolitan areas. Racial differences also exist in syringe sharing, which decreased among Black people and Hispanic people but remained unchanged among White people in 2005-15. Recent HIV outbreaks have occurred in rural areas of the USA, as well as among marginalised people in urban areas with robust HIV prevention and treatment services (eg, Seattle, WA). Multiple evidence-based interventions can effectively treat opioid use disorder and prevent HIV acquisition. However, considerable barriers exist precluding delivery of these solutions to many people who inject drugs. If the USA is serious about HIV prevention among this group, stigma must be eliminated, discriminatory policies must change, and comprehensive health care must be accessible to all. Finally, root causes of the opioid epidemic such as hopelessness need to be identified and addressed.","[Hodder, Sally L.; Feinberg, Judith] West Virginia Univ, Univ Hlth Sci Ctr, West Virginia Clin & Translat Sci Inst, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Strathdee, Steffanie A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Shoptaw, Steven] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Altice, Frederick L.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT USA; [Ortenzio, Louis] Clarksburg Mission, Clarksburg, WV USA; [Beyrer, Chris] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Publ Hlth & Human Rights, Baltimore, MD USA",,"Hodder, SL (corresponding author), West Virginia Univ, Univ Hlth Sci Ctr, West Virginia Clin & Translat Sci Inst, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",slhodder@hsc.wvu.edu,,"feinberg, judith/0000-0003-4206-7214; Shoptaw, Steven/0000-0002-3583-0026","Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR); National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [R01-DA030768, U01 DA045384, R01 DA033679, R01 DA043125, R01 DA029910]; West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute [NIGMS U54GM104942]; NIDA Merit Award [R37-DA019829]",Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR); National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)); West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute; NIDA Merit Award,"This Series paper was supported by unrestricted grants from the Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR), the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA; R01-DA030768, U01 DA045384, R01 DA033679, R01 DA043125, R01 DA029910), and the West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute NIGMS U54GM104942), and by a NIDA Merit Award (R37-DA019829).",,109,20,20,1,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,MAR 20,2021,397,10279,,,,,1139,1150,,10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00391-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00391-3,,MAR 2021,12,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),General & Internal Medicine,QZ0AN,33617769,,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000630397800031,View Full Record in Web of Science,64230,0,88,63,17,21,24,32,107,67,22,92,46,55,65,16,43

The combination antiretroviral regimen, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine, taken as a single pill once daily, has been shown to prevent HIV transmission but is used by fewer than 20% of people who could benefit in the United States. OBSERVATIONS PubMed was searched on February 15, 2018, using the search terms pre-exposure, prophylaxis, HIV, and PrEP to identify English-language articles published between 2010 and 2018. Four placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with daily dosing of TDF/emtricitabine significantly reduces HIV acquisition in men who have sex with men, high-risk heterosexuals, and injection drug users who share injection equipment. The efficacy of daily TDF/emtricitabine exceeds 90% but is highly correlated with degree of adherence. TDF/emtricitabine is safe and well-tolerated. Only 2% of people discontinue PrEP because of adverse effects. Sexually transmitted infections are common among those using PrEP. Resistance to TDF/emtricitabine when used for PrEP is rare (<0.1%) and usually occurs when PrEP is inadvertently prescribed to individuals with undiagnosed acute HIV infection who have false-negative findings on HIV antibody/antigen testing due to HIV infection acquired within 7 to 10 days of testing. Effective methods are needed to identify individuals at high risk for acquiring HIV, ensure their access to PrEP, and maximize medication adherence. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE TDF/emtricitabine is an effective and safe therapy for preventing HIV transmission. Increasing prescription of TDF/emtricitabine for patients at risk of acquiring HIV has the potential to reduce new HIV infections.","[Riddell, James] Univ Michigan, Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Div Infect Dis, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Amico, Rivet] Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Behav & Hlth Educ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Mayer, Kenneth H.] Fenway Hlth, Fenway Inst, Boston, MA USA; [Mayer, Kenneth H.] Harvard Med Sch, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Med, Boston, MA USA; [Mayer, Kenneth H.] Harvard Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth & Populat, Boston, MA USA",,"Riddell, J (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Med Ctr, 1500 E Med Ctr Dr,Univ Hosp South F4131, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",jriddell@umich.edu,/AAE-4700-2020,"Amico, K Rivet/0000-0002-4458-6934",GlaxoSmithKline; ViiV Healthcare; University of Michigan from Gilead Sciences for material development; Gilead Sciences,GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline); ViiV Healthcare; University of Michigan from Gilead Sciences for material development; Gilead Sciences(Gilead Sciences),All authors have completed and submitted the ICMJE Form for Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest.

There is substantial variability in how neonatal abstinence syndrome is diagnosed and managed. OBJECTIVE To summarize key studies examining the diagnosis and management (both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic) of neonatal abstinence syndrome published during the past 10 years. EVIDENCE REVIEW PubMed, Web of Science, and CINAHL were searched for articles published between July 1, 2007, and December 31, 2017. Abstracts were screened and included in the review if they pertained to neonatal abstinence syndrome diagnosis or management and were judged by the authors to be clinical trials, cohort studies, or case series. FINDINGS A total of 53 articles were included in the review, including 9 randomized clinical trials, 35 cohort studies, 1 cross-sectional study, and 8 case series-representing a total of 11 905 unique opioid-exposed mother-infant dyads. Thirteen studies were identified that evaluated established or novel neonatal abstinence syndrome assessment methods, such as brief neonatal abstinence syndrome assessment scales or novel objective physiologic measures to predict withdrawal. None of the new techniques that measure infant physiologic parameters are routinely used in clinical practice. The most substantial number of studies of neonatal abstinence syndrome management pertain to nonpharmacologic care-specifically, interventions that promote breastfeeding or encourage parents to room-in with their newborns. Although these nonpharmacologic interventions appear to decrease the need for pharmacologic treatment and result in shorter hospitalizations, the interventions are heterogeneous and there are no high-quality clinical trials to support them. Regarding pharmacologic interventions, only 5 randomized clinical trials with prespecified sample size calculations (4 infant, 1 maternal treatment) have been published. Each of these trials was small (from 26 to 131 participants) and tested different therapies, limiting the extent to which results can be aggregated. There is insufficient evidence to support an association between any diagnostic or treatment approach and differential neurodevelopmental outcomes among infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Evidence pertaining to the optimal diagnosis and treatment strategies for neonatal abstinence syndrome is based on small or low-quality studies that focus on intermediate outcomes, such as need for pharmacologic treatment or length of hospital stay. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate health and neurodevelopmental outcomes associated with objective diagnostic approaches as well as pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment modalities.","[Wachman, Elisha M.; Silverstein, Michael] Boston Med Ctr, Grayken Ctr Addict, Boston, MA USA; [Wachman, Elisha M.; Silverstein, Michael] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Schiff, Davida M.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp Children, Div Gen Acad Pediat, Boston, MA USA; [Schiff, Davida M.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA USA",,"Wachman, EM (corresponding author), Boston Med Ctr, 771 Albany St,Dowling 4103, Boston, MA 02118 USA.",elisha.wachman@bmc.org,,,NICHD NIH HHS [K24 HD081057] Funding Source: Medline; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT [K24HD081057] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,73,88,88,1,27,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Predicting its occurrence is important because the mortality rate is high when untreated. OBJECTIVE To assess the accuracy and predictive value of symptoms and signs for identifying hospitalized patients at risk of SAWS, defined as delirium tremens, withdrawal seizure, or clinically diagnosed severe withdrawal. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE and EMBASE (1946-January 2018) were searched for articles investigating symptoms and signs predictive of SAWS in adults. Reference lists of retrieved articles were also searched. STUDY SELECTION Original studies that were included compared symptoms, signs, and risk assessment tools among patients who developed SAWS and patients who did not. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were extracted and used to calculate likelihood ratios (LRs), sensitivity, and specificity. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate summary LR. RESULTS Of 530 identified studies, 14 high-quality studies that included 71 295 patients and 1355 relevant cases of SAWS (1051 cases), seizure (53 cases), or delirium tremens (251 cases) were analyzed. A history of delirium tremens (LR, 2.9 [95% CI 1.7-5.2]) and baseline systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or higher (LR, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.3-2.3) were associated with an increased likelihood of SAWS. No single symptom or sign was associated with exclusion of SAWS. Six high-quality studies evaluated combinations of clinical findings and were useful for identifying patients in acute care facilities at high risk of developing SAWS. Of these combinations, the Prediction of Alcohol Withdrawal Severity Scale (PAWSS) was most useful, with an LR of 174 (95% CI, 43-696; specificity, 0.93) when patients had 4 or more individual findings and an LR of 0.07 (95% CI, 0.02-0.26; sensitivity, 0.99) when there were 3 or fewer findings. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Assessment tools that use a combination of symptoms and signs are useful for identifying patients at risk of developing severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Most studies of these tools were not fully validated, limiting their generalizability.","[Wood, Evan; Ahamad, Keith; Nolan, Seonaid; McLean, Mark; Klimas, Jan] British Columbia Ctr Substance Use, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Wood, Evan; Tkachuk, Stacey; Green, Carolyn J.; Ahamad, Keith; Nolan, Seonaid; McLean, Mark; Klimas, Jan] Univ British Columbia, Fac Med, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Albarqouni, Loai] Bond Univ, Robina, Qld, Australia",,"Wood, E (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, BC Ctr Subst Use, 400-1045 Howe St, Vancouver, BC V6Z 2A9, Canada.",bccsu-ew@bccsu.ubc.ca,"Klimas, Jan/E-7191-2010; Albarqouni, Loai/I-1295-2019","Klimas, Jan/0000-0002-5179-0052; Albarqouni, Loai/0000-0002-4114-9106",Canada Research Chairs program through a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Inner City Medicine; ELEVATE grant from the Irish Research Council International Career Development Fellowship [PD/2014]; Marie Curie Actions; European Commission [7 01698]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research Embedded Clinician Scientist Award; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE [R25DA037756] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,Canada Research Chairs program through a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Inner City Medicine(Canada Research Chairs); ELEVATE grant from the Irish Research Council International Career Development Fellowship; Marie Curie Actions(European Commission); European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Canadian Institutes of Health Research Embedded Clinician Scientist Award(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission),"This research was supported in part by funding from the Canada Research Chairs program through a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Inner City Medicine (Dr Wood); the ELEVATE grant PD/2014 from the Irish Research Council International Career Development Fellowship, cofunded by Marie Curie Actions; and grant 7 01698 from the European Commission (Dr Klimas).

In this Review, we provide a profile of the long-term care system and policy landscape in China. The long-term care system is characterised by rapid growth of the residential care sector, slow development of home and community-based services, and increasing involvement of the private sector. The long-term care workforce shortage and weak quality assurance are concerning. Public long-term care financing is minimal and largely limited to supporting welfare recipients and subsidising the construction of residential care beds and operating costs. China is piloting social insurance long-term care financing models and, concurrently, programmes for integrating health care and long-term care services in selected settings across the country; the effectiveness and sustainability of these pilots remain to be seen. Informed by international long-term care experiences, we offer policy recommendations to strengthen the evolving care system for older people in China.","[Feng, Zhanlian] RTI Int, Waltham, MA USA; [Glinskaya, Elena] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Yip, Winnie] Harvard Univ, Dept Global Hlth & Populat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Chen, Hongtu] Harvard Univ, Dept Global Hlth & Social Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Chen, Hongtu] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gong, Sen] Ctr Int Knowledge Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Yue] China Dev Res Fdn, Dev Res Ctr State Council, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jianming] Fudan Univ, Sch Nursing, Shanghai, Peoples R China",,"Yip, WN (corresponding author), Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth & Populat, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",wyip@hsph.harvard.edu,"Feng, Zhanlian/AAA-8985-2021","Feng, Zhanlian/0000-0002-5231-6870",,,,,86,43,43,27,91,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,OCT 24,2020,396,10259,,,,,1362,1372,,,,,,11,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),General & Internal Medicine,OF2SS,34338215,,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000581064900032,View Full Record in Web of Science,64815,0,72,52,77,14,81,56,79,80,9,38,39,29,53,30,11

We aimed to systematically review the evidence for the duration of protection of COVID-19 vaccines against various clinical outcomes, and to assess changes in the rates of breakthrough infection caused by the delta variant with increasing time since vaccination. Methods This study was designed as a systematic review and meta-regression. We did a systematic review of preprint and peer-reviewed published article databases from June 17, 2021, to Dec 2, 2021. Randomised controlled trials of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and observational studies of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness were eligible. Studies with vaccine efficacy or effectiveness estimates at discrete time intervals of people who had received full vaccination and that met predefined screening criteria underwent full-text review. We used random-effects meta-regression to estimate the average change in vaccine efficacy or effectiveness 1-6 months after full vaccination. Findings Of 13 744 studies screened, 310 underwent full-text review, and 18 studies were included (all studies were carried out before the omicron variant began to circulate widely). Risk of bias, established using the risk of bias 2 tool for randomised controlled trials or the risk of bias in non-randomised studies of interventions tool was low for three studies, moderate for eight studies, and serious for seven studies. We included 78 vaccine-specific vaccine efficacy or effectiveness evaluations (Pfizer-BioNTech-Comirnaty, n=38; Moderna-mRNA-1273, n=23; Janssen-Ad26.COV2.S, n=9; and AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria, n=8). On average, vaccine efficacy or effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection decreased from 1 month to 6 months after full vaccination by 21.0 percentage points (95% CI 13 .9-29.8) among people of all ages and 20.7 percentage points (10. 2-36.6) among older people (as defined by each study, who were at least 50 years old). For symptomatic COVID- 19 disease, vaccine efficacy or effectiveness decreased by 24.9 percentage points (95% CI 13.4-41.6) in people of all ages and 32.0 percentage points (11. 0-69.0) in older people. For severe COVID-19 disease, vaccine efficacy or effectiveness decreased by 10 .0 percentage points (95% CI 6.1-15.4) in people of all ages and 9.5 percentage points (5.7-14.6) in older people. Most (81%) vaccine efficacy or effectiveness estimates against severe disease remained greater than 70% over time. Interpretation COVID-19 vaccine efficacy or effectiveness against severe disease remained high, although it did decrease somewhat by 6 months after full vaccination. By contrast, vaccine efficacy or effectiveness against infection and symptomatic disease decreased approximately 20-30 percentage points by 6 months. The decrease in vaccine efficacy or effectiveness is likely caused by, at least in part, waning immunity, although an effect of bias cannot be ruled out. Evaluating vaccine efficacy or effectiveness beyond 6 months will be crucial for updating COVID-19 vaccine policy. Copyright (C) 2022 The Author(s).

Given that many factors contribute to ischaemic heart disease, a multifactorial approach to prevention is recommended, starting with lifestyle advice, smoking cessation, and control of known cardiovascular risk factors, such as blood pressure and lipids. Within the lipid profile, the principal target is lowering LDL cholesterol, firstly with lifestyle interventions and subsequently with pharmacological therapy. Statins are the recommended first-line pharmacological treatment. Some individuals might require further lowering of LDL cholesterol or be unable to tolerate statins. Additional therapies targeting different pathways in cholesterol metabolism are now available, ranging from small molecules taken orally, to injectable therapies. Examples include ezetimibe, which targets Niemann-Pick C1-like protein, and monoclonal antibodies that target PCSK9. Phase 3 trials have also been completed for bempedoic acid (targeting ATP-citrate lyase) and inclisiran (an interference RNA-based therapeutic targeting hepatic PCSK9 synthesis). In addition to LDL cholesterol, mendelian randomisation studies support a causal role for lipoprotein(a) and triglycerides in ischaemic heart disease. In this Series paper, we appraise currently available and emerging therapies for lowering LDL cholesterol, lipoprotein(a), and triglycerides for prevention of ischaemic heart disease.","[Ray, Kausik K.] Imperial Coll London, Sch Publ Hlth, Imperial Ctr Cardiovasc Dis Prevent, London W6 8RP, England; [Corral, Pablo] FASTA Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Mar Del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Morales, Enrique] MAC Hosp, Cardiometab Res Ctr, Aguascalientes, Mexico; [Nicholls, Stephen J.] Monash Univ, Monash Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,"Ray, KK (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Sch Publ Hlth, Imperial Ctr Cardiovasc Dis Prevent, London W6 8RP, England.",k.ray@imperial.ac.uk,"Keskin, Kudret/AAB-8198-2019; Ray, Kausik/Z-2055-2019","Keskin, Kudret/0000-0002-9049-1530; Corral, Pablo/0000-0003-0017-8725",National Institute for Health Research Imperial Biomedical Research Centre,National Institute for Health Research Imperial Biomedical Research Centre,KKR acknowledges support from the National Institute for Health Research Imperial Biomedical Research Centre.,,100,40,40,1,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,AUG 24,2019,394,10199,,,,,697,708,,10.1016/S0140-6736(19)31950-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(19)31950-6,,,12,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,IT6UU,31448741,Green Submitted,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000483011200034,View Full Record in Web of Science,65097,0,63,50,34,98,48,95,75,78,62,6,40,62,53,71,65

Contrary to popular belief, the disorder is modestly more common in men than in women. Nor is the outcome uniformly poor. A division of symptoms into positive, negative, and disorganisation syndromes is supported by factor analysis. Catatonic symptoms are not specific to schizophrenia and so-called first rank symptoms are no longer considered diagnostically important. Cognitive impairment is now recognised as a further clinical feature of the disorder. Lateral ventricular enlargement and brain volume reductions of around 2% are established findings. Brain functional changes occur in different subregions of the frontal cortex and might ultimately be understandable in terms of disturbed interaction among large-scale brain networks. Neurochemical disturbance, involving dopamine function and glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor function, is supported by indirect and direct evidence. The genetic contribution to schizophrenia is now recognised to be largely polygenic. Birth and early life factors also have an important aetiological role. The mainstay of treatment remains dopamine receptor-blocking drugs; a psychological intervention, cognitive behavioural therapy, has relatively small effects on symptoms. The idea that schizophrenia is better regarded as the extreme end of a continuum of psychotic symptoms is currently influential. Other areas of debate include cannabis and childhood adversity as causative factors, whether there is progressive brain change after onset, and the long-term success of early intervention initiatives.","[Jauhar, Sameer; Johnstone, Mandy] Kings Coll London, Dept Psychol Med, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, London, England; [Johnstone, Mandy] South London & Maudsley NHS Fdn Trust, Natl Psychosis Serv, London, England; [McKenna, Peter J.] FIDMAG Hermanas Hospitalarias Res Fdn, Barcelona 08830, Spain; [McKenna, Peter J.] Ctr Invest Biomed Red Salud Mental, Madrid, Spain",,"McKenna, PJ (corresponding author), FIDMAG Hermanas Hospitalarias Res Fdn, Barcelona 08830, Spain.",mckennapeter1@gmail.com,,"Jauhar, Sameer/0000-0002-3878-3659",FIDMAG Hermanas Hospitalarias; Spanish CIBERSAM research network,FIDMAG Hermanas Hospitalarias; Spanish CIBERSAM research network,"SJ is funded by the National Institute for Health Research Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London.

Decades of grassroots campaigns have helped to raise awareness about the impact of cardiovascular disease in women, and positive changes affecting women and their health have gained momentum. Despite these efforts, there has been stagnation in the overall reduction of cardiovascular disease burden for women in the past decade. Cardiovascular disease in women remains understudied, under-recognised, underdiagnosed, and undertreated. This Commission summarises existing evidence and identifies knowledge gaps in research, prevention, treatment, and access to care for women. Recommendations from an international team of experts and leaders in the field have been generated with a clear focus to reduce the global burden of cardiovascular disease in women by 2030. This Commission represents the first effort of its kind to connect stakeholders, to ignite global awareness of sex-related and gender-related disparities in cardiovascular disease, and to provide a springboard for future research.","[Vogel, Birgit; Mehran, Roxana] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Acevedo, Monica] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Med, Div Enfermedades Cardiovasc, Santiago, Chile; [Appelman, Yolande] Vrije Univ Amsterdam Med Ctr, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Merz, C.

Disturbed attitudes towards weight, body shape, and eating play a key role in the origin and maintenance of eating disorders. Eating disorders have been increasing over the past 50 years and changes in the food environment have been implicated. All health-care providers should routinely enquire about eating habits as a component of overall health assessment. Six main feeding and eating disorders are now recognised in diagnostic systems: anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder, pica, and rumination disorder. The presentation form of eating disorders might vary for men versus women, for example. As eating disorders are under-researched, there is a great deal of uncertainty as to their pathophysiology, treatment, and management.

Research advances have led to a more accurate assessment of fracture risk and have increased the range of therapeutic options available to prevent fractures. Fracture risk algorithms that combine clinical risk factors and bone mineral density are now widely used in clinical practice to target high-risk individuals for treatment. The discovery of key pathways regulating bone resorption and formation has identified new approaches to treatment with distinctive mechanisms of action. Osteoporosis is a chronic condition and long-term, sometimes lifelong, management is required. In individuals at high risk of fracture, the benefit versus risk profile is likely to be favourable for up to 10 years of treatment with bisphosphonates or denosumab. In people at a very high or imminent risk of fracture, therapy with teriparatide or abaloparatide should be considered; however, since treatment duration with these drugs is restricted to 18-24 months, treatment should be continued with an antiresorptive drug. Individuals at high risk of fractures do not receive adequate treatment and strategies to address this treatment gap-eg, widespread implementation of Fracture Liaison Services and improvement of adherence to therapy-are important challenges for the future.","[Compston, Juliet E.] Cambridge Biomed Campus, Dept Med, Cambridge CB2 0SL, England; [McClung, Michael R.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Med, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [McClung, Michael R.] Australian Catholic Univ, Mary MacKillop Inst Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Leslie, William D.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Internal Med, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",,"Compston, JE (corresponding author), Cambridge Biomed Campus, Dept Med, Cambridge CB2 0SL, England.",jec1001@cam.ac.uk,"McClung, Michael/ABA-4100-2021","McClung, Michael/0000-0002-7827-0778",,,,,145,578,610,86,479,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,JAN 26,2019,393,10169,,,,,364,376,,10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32112-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32112-3,,,13,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,HI9WK,30696576,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000456808200028,View Full Record in Web of Science,65575,0,77,79,77,130,34,113,53,112,83,97,64,82,139,88,21

Although routine screening for heavy alcohol use can identify patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and has been recommended, only 1 in 6 US adults report ever having been asked by a health professional about their drinking behavior. Alcohol use disorder, a problematic pattern of alcohol use accompanied by clinically significant impairment or distress, is present in up to 14% of US adults during a 1-year period, although only about 8% of affected individuals are treated in an alcohol treatment facility. OBSERVATIONS Four medications are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat AUD: disulfiram, naltrexone (oral and long-acting injectable formulations), and acamprosate. However, patients with AUD most commonly receive counseling. Medications are prescribed to less than 9% of patients who are likely to benefit from them, given evidence that they exert clinically meaningful effects and their inclusion in clinical practice guidelines as first-line treatments for moderate to severe AUD. Naltrexone, which can be given once daily, reduces the likelihood of a return to any drinking by 5% and binge-drinking risk by 10%. Randomized clinical trials also show that some medications approved for other indications, including seizure disorder (eg, topiramate), are efficacious in treating AUD. Currently, there is not sufficient evidence to support the use of pharmacogenetics to personalize AUD treatments. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Alcohol consumption is associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality, and heavy alcohol use is the major risk factor for AUD. Simple, valid screeningmethods can be used to identify patients with heavy alcohol use, who can then be evaluated for the presence of an AUD. Patients receiving a diagnosis of the disorder should be given brief counseling and prescribed a first-line medication (eg, naltrexone) or referred for a more intensive psychosocial intervention.","[Kranzler, Henry R.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kranzler, Henry R.] Crescenz Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Soyka, Michael] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Psychiat, Munich, Germany; [Soyka, Michael] Medicalpk Chiemseeblick, Bernau Felden, Germany",,"Kranzler, HR (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Ctr Studies Addict, 3535 Market St,Ste 500, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",kranzler@pennmedicine.upenn.edu,"kranzler, henry/AAS-1113-2020","kranzler, henry/0000-0002-1018-0450","National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [R01 AA023192, R01 AA021164]; Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Center of the Veterans Integrated Service Network 4, US Department of Veterans Affairs; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM [R01AA021164, R01AA023192] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA)); Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Center of the Veterans Integrated Service Network 4, US Department of Veterans Affairs; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA))","Dr Kranzler's work was supported by National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism grants R01 AA023192 and R01 AA021164 and the Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Center of the Veterans Integrated Service Network 4, US Department of Veterans Affairs.",,67,187,190,10,39,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

OBJECTIVE To identify the clinical findings that are most strongly associated with hip OA. DATA SOURCES Systematic search of MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL from inception until November 2019. STUDY SELECTION Included studies (1) quantified the accuracy of clinical findings (history, physical examination, or simple tests) and (2) used plain radiographs as the reference standard for diagnosing hip OA. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Studieswere assigned levels of evidence using the Rational Clinical Examination scale and assessed for risk of bias using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. Data were extracted using individual hips as the unit of analysis and only pooled when findings were reported in 3 or more studies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs). RESULTS Six studies were included, with data from 1110 patients and 1324 hips, of which 509 (38%) showed radiographic evidence of OA. Among patients presenting to primary care physicians with hip or groin pain, the affected hip showed radiographic evidence of OA in 34% of cases. A family history of OA, personal history of knee OA, or pain on climbing stairs or walking up slopes all had LRs of 2.1 (sensitivity range, 33%-68%; specificity range, 68%-84%; broadest LR range: 95% CI, 1.1-3.8). To identify patients most likely to have OA, the most useful findings were squat causing posterior pain (sensitivity, 24%; specificity, 96%; LR, 6.1 [95% CI, 1.3-29]), groin pain on passive abduction or adduction (sensitivity, 33%; specificity, 94%; LR, 5.7 [95% CI, 1.6-20]), abductor weakness (sensitivity, 44%; specificity, 90%; LR, 4.5 [95% CI, 2.4-8.4]), and decreased passive hip adduction (sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 81%; LR, 4.2 [95% CI, 3.0-6.0]) or internal rotation (sensitivity, 66%; specificity, 79%; LR, 3.2 [95% CI, 1.7-6.0]) as measured by a goniometer or compared with the contralateral leg. The presence of normal passive hip adduction was most useful for suggesting the absence of OA (negative LR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.11-0.54]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Simple tests of hip motion and observing for pain during that motion were helpful in distinguishing patients most likely to have OA on plain radiography from those who will not. A combination of findings efficiently detects those most likely to have severe hip OA.","[Metcalfe, David; Perry, Daniel C.; Claireaux, Henry A.; Costa, Matthew L.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Orthopaed Rheumatol & Musculoskelet, Oxford, England; [Simel, David L.] Durham Vet Affairs Hlth Syst, Durham, NC USA; [Simel, David L.] Duke Univ, Durham, NC USA; [Zogg, Cheryl K.] Yale Univ, Yale Sch Med, New Haven, CT USA",,"Metcalfe, D (corresponding author), John Radcliffe Hosp, Kadoorie Ctr Crit Care Res, Level 3,Headley Way, Oxford OX3 9DU, England.",david.metcalfe@ndorms.ox.ac.uk,"Metcalfe, David/D-9699-2012","Metcalfe, David/0000-0003-1008-3105; Perry, Daniel/0000-0001-8420-8252","Royal College of Surgeons of England Fulbright Scholarship; UCB-Oxford Prize Fellowship in Biomedical Research; Durham Center of Innovation to Accelerate Discovery and Practice Transformation (ADAPT) at the Durham VA Health Care System [CIN 13-410]; Academy of Medical Sciences (AMS) [AMS-SGCL10-Perry] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [CS-2014-14-012, CL-2012-08-002] Funding Source: researchfish",Royal College of Surgeons of England Fulbright Scholarship; UCB-Oxford Prize Fellowship in Biomedical Research; Durham Center of Innovation to Accelerate Discovery and Practice Transformation (ADAPT) at the Durham VA Health Care System; Academy of Medical Sciences (AMS)(Academy of Medical Sciences (AMS)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)),Dr Metcalfe was funded by a Royal College of Surgeons of England Fulbright Scholarship and a UCB-Oxford Prize Fellowship in Biomedical Research.

Among individuals with chronic HBV infection who are untreated, 15% to 40% progress to cirrhosis, which may lead to liver failure and liver cancer. OBSERVATIONS Pegylated interferon and nucleos(t)ide analogues (lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, tenofovir disoproxil, and tenofovir alafenamide) suppress HBV DNA replication and improve liver inflammation and fibrosis. Long-term viral suppression is associated with regression of liver fibrosis and reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in cohort studies. The cure (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen loss with undetectable HBV DNA) rates after treatment remain low (3%-7% with pegylated interferon and 1%-12% with nucleos[t] ide analogue therapy). Pegylated interferon therapy can be completed in 48 weeks and is not associated with the development of resistance; however, its use is limited by poor tolerability and adverse effects such as bone marrow suppression and exacerbation of existing neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression. Newer agents (entecavir, tenofovir disoproxil, and tenofovir alafenamide) may be associated with a significantly reduced risk of drug resistance compared with older agents (lamivudine and adefovir) and should be considered as the first-line treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Antiviral treatment with either pegylated interferon or a nucleos(t) ide analogue (lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, tenofovir disoproxil, or tenofovir alafenamide) should be offered to patients with chronic HBV infection and liver inflammation in an effort to reduce progression of liver disease. Nucleos(t)ide analogues should be considered as first-line therapy. Because cure rates are low, most patients will require therapy indefinitely.","[Tang, Lydia S.

Data from cardiovascular outcome trials have highlighted that these drugs confer protection against major cardiovascular disease in those with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, reduce the risk of admission to hospital for heart failure, and reduce cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Ongoing research using hard renal endpoints such as end stage kidney disease rather than surrogate markers might clarify the renoprotective benefits of both agents. When used for glucose lowering, SGLT2 inhibitors are most effective if the estimated glomerular filtration rate is more than 60 ml per min per 1.73m(2) at initiation and should be avoided where there is a risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. GLP- 1 receptor agonists are contraindicated in those with a history of medullary thyroid cancer and used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis of a known cause. These drugs are now second-line, or even arguably first-line, glucose lowering therapies in patients with cardiorenal disease, irrespective of glycaemic control. If an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist is considered suitable in patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment should be prioritised according to existing evidence: GLP-1 receptor agonists should be considered in patients at a high risk of, or with established, cardiovascular disease and SGLT2 inhibitors considered for patients with heart failure ( with reduced ejection fraction) or chronic kidney disease (with or without established cardiovascular disease). There is now compelling data on the benefits of these drugs for a range of other clinical indications even without type 2 diabetes, including for GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with obesity and overweight with weight-related comorbidities.","[Brown, Emily; Cuthbertson, Daniel J.; Wilding, John P.

Singapore is achieving good health outcomes, with a total health expenditure of 4.47% of gross domestic product in 2016. However, the health-care system is contending with increased stress, as reflected in so-called pain points that have led to public concern, including shortages in acute hospital beds and intermediate and long-term care (ILTC) services, and high out-of-pocket payments. The main drivers of these challenges are the rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases and rapid population ageing, limitations in the delivery and organisation of primary care and ILTC, and financial incentives that might inadvertently impede care integration. To address these challenges, Singapore's Ministry of Health implemented a comprehensive set of reforms in 2012 under its Healthcare 2020 Masterplan. These reforms substantially increased the capacity of public hospital beds and ILTC services in the community, expanded subsidies for primary care and long-term care, and introduced a series of financing health-care reforms to strengthen financial protection and coverage. However, it became clear that these measures alone would not address the underlying drivers of system stress in the long term. Instead, the system requires, and is making, much more fundamental changes to its approach. In 2016, the Ministry of Health encapsulated the required shifts in terms of the so-called Three Beyonds-namely, beyond health care to health, beyond hospital to community, and beyond quality to value.","[Tan, Chorh Chuan] Minist Hlth, Off Healthcare Transformat, Singapore 099253, Singapore; [Tan, Chorh Chuan; Wong, John E.

Hallmark clinical features are unintentional weight loss, anorexia, postural hypotension, profound fatigue, muscle and abdominal pain, and hyponatraemia. Additionally, patients with primary adrenal insufficiency usually develop skin hyperpigmentation and crave salt. Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is usually delayed because the initial presentation is often non-specific; physician awareness must be improved to avoid adrenal crisis. Despite state-of-the-art steroid replacement therapy, reduced quality of life and work capacity, and increased mortality is reported in patients with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. Active and repeated patient education on managing adrenal insufficiency, including advice on how to increase medication during intercurrent illness, medical or dental procedures, and profound stress, is required to prevent adrenal crisis, which occurs in about 50% of patients with adrenal insufficiency after diagnosis. It is good practice for physicians to provide patients with a steroid card, parenteral hydrocortisone, and training for parenteral hydrocortisone administration, in case of vomiting or severe illness. New modes of glucocorticoid delivery could improve the quality of life in some patients with adrenal insufficiency, and further advances in oral and parenteral therapy will probably emerge in the next few years.","[Husebye, Eystein S.; Kaempe, Olle] Univ Bergen, Dept Clin Sci, N-5021 Bergen, Norway; [Husebye, Eystein S.; Kaempe, Olle] Univ Bergen, KGJebsen Ctr Autoimmune Disorders, Bergen, Norway; [Husebye, Eystein S.] Haukeland Hosp, Dept Med, Bergen, Norway; [Husebye, Eystein S.; Kaempe, Olle] Karolinska Inst, Dept Med, Stockholm, Sweden; [Pearce, Simon H.] Newcastle Univ, Translat & Clin Res Inst, Dept Endocrinol, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Krone, Nils P.] Univ Sheffield, Acad Unit Child Hlth, Dept Oncol & Metab, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Krone, Nils P.] Tech Univ Dresden, Dept Med 3, Univ Hosp Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany; [Kaempe, Olle] Karolinska Univ Hosp, Ctr Mol Med, Stockholm, Sweden; [Kaempe, Olle] Karolinska Univ Hosp, Dept Endocrinol Metab & Diabet, Stockholm, Sweden",,"Husebye, ES (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Dept Clin Sci, N-5021 Bergen, Norway.;Husebye, ES (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, KGJebsen Ctr Autoimmune Disorders, Bergen, Norway.",eyhu@helse-bergen.no,,"Pearce, Simon/0000-0001-8384-8063","KG Jebsen Center for Autoimmune Disorders; Novo Nordisk Foundation; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation; Swedish Research Council; Norwegian Research Council; Regional Health Authorities of Western Norway; Stockholm County Council; Torsten Soderberg Foundation; Ragnar Soderberg Foundation; German Research Foundation (DFG) [KR3363/3-1]; Medical Research Council, UK [MR/J002526/1]; Robotham family; MRC [G0701632, MR/J002526/1, G0900001] Funding Source: UKRI","KG Jebsen Center for Autoimmune Disorders; Novo Nordisk Foundation(Novo Nordisk FoundationNovocure Limited); Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation(Knut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission); Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of NorwayEuropean Commission); Regional Health Authorities of Western Norway; Stockholm County Council(Stockholm County Council); Torsten Soderberg Foundation; Ragnar Soderberg Foundation; German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Medical Research Council, UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Robotham family; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))","This Seminar was supported by the KG Jebsen Center for Autoimmune Disorders, the Novo Nordisk Foundation, the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, Swedish and Norwegian Research Councils, Regional Health Authorities of Western Norway, Stockholm County Council, the Torsten and Ragnar Soderberg Foundations, the German Research Foundation (DFG; KR3363/3-1), the Medical Research Council, UK (MR/J002526/1), and the Robotham family.",,142,28,30,6,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,FEB 13,2021,397,10274,,,,,613,629,,10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00136-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00136-7,,FEB 2021,17,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,QL2TN,33484633,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000620934000026,View Full Record in Web of Science,66170,0,35,9,17,54,35,103,12,66,41,60,23,76,106,59,66

The mechanisms that underlie this type of pain are not entirely understood, but it is thought that augmented CNS pain and sensory processing and altered pain modulation play prominent roles. The symptoms observed in nociplastic pain include multifocal pain that is more widespread or intense, or both, than would be expected given the amount of identifiable tissue or nerve damage, as well as other CNS-derived symptoms, such as fatigue, sleep, memory, and mood problems. This type of pain can occur in isolation, as often occurs in conditions such as fibromyalgia or tension-type headache, or as part of a mixed-pain state in combination with ongoing nociceptive or neuropathic pain, as might occur in chronic low back pain. It is important to recognise this type of pain, since it will respond to different therapies than nociceptive pain, with a decreased responsiveness to peripherally directed therapies such as anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids, surgery, or injections.","[Fitzcharles, Mary-Ann] McGill Univ, Dept Rheumatol, Montreal, PQ H3G 1A4, Canada; [Fitzcharles, Mary-Ann] McGill Univ, Alan Edwards Pain Management Unit, Montreal, PQ H3G 1A4, Canada; [Cohen, Steven P.] Johns Hopkins Univ Hosp, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Cohen, Steven P.] Johns Hopkins Univ Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol & Crit Care Med, Neurol & Phys Med & Rehabil, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Cohen, Steven P.] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Clauw, Daniel J.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol, Chron Pain & Fatigue Res Ctr, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Clauw, Daniel J.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Med, Chron Pain & Fatigue Res Ctr, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA; [Clauw, Daniel J.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Chron Pain & Fatigue Res Ctr, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Littlejohn, Geoffrey] Monash Hlth, Dept Rheumatol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Littlejohn, Geoffrey] Monash Hlth, Dept Med, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Littlejohn, Geoffrey] Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Usui, Chie] Juntendo Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Tokyo, Japan; [Haeuser, Winfried] Klinikum Saarbrucken, Dept Internal Med 1, Saarbrucken, Germany; [Haeuser, Winfried] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Psychosomat Med & Psychotherapy, Munich, Germany",,"Fitzcharles, MA (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Rheumatol, Montreal, PQ H3G 1A4, Canada.;Fitzcharles, MA (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Alan Edwards Pain Management Unit, Montreal, PQ H3G 1A4, Canada.",mary-ann.fitzcharles.med@ssss.gouv.qc.ca,,,,,,,116,64,66,23,46,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,MAY 29,2021,397,10289,,,,,2098,2110,,,,,,13,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,SK5LX,34062144,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000656257800028,View Full Record in Web of Science,66642,0,95,1,50,44,24,14,19,34,59,92,36,100,9,40,79

Persons born in regions with a prevalence of HBV infection of 2% or greater, such as countries in Africa and Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of South America, often become infected at birth and account for up to 95% of newly reported chronic infections in the US. Other high-prevalence populations include persons who inject drugs; men who have sex with men; persons with HIV infection; and sex partners, needle-sharing contacts, and household contacts of persons with chronic HBV infection. Up to 60% of HBV-infected persons are unaware of their infection, and many remain asymptomatic until onset of cirrhosis or end-stage liver disease. ObjectiveTo update its 2014 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of new randomized clinical trials and cohort studies published from 2014 to August 2019 that evaluated the benefits and harms of screening and antiviral therapy for preventing intermediate outcomes or health outcomes and the association between improvements in intermediate outcomes and health outcomes. New key questions focused on the yield of alternative HBV screening strategies and the accuracy of tools to identify persons at increased risk. PopulationThis recommendation statement applies to asymptomatic, nonpregnant adolescents and adults at increased risk for HBV infection, including those who were vaccinated before being screened for HBV infection.

GOVERNMENT; ACCESS; PRIVATE; REFORM; DETERMINANTS; POPULATION; INTEGRATION; INSURANCE; MORTALITY,"Access to health care based on need rather than ability to pay was the founding principle of the Canadian health-care system. Medicare was born in one province in 1947. It spread across the country through federal cost sharing, and eventually was harmonised through standards in a federal law, the Canada Health Act of 1984. The health-care system is less a true national system than a decentralised collection of provincial and territorial insurance plans covering a narrow basket of services, which are free at the point of care. Administration and service delivery are highly decentralised, although coverage is portable across the country. In the setting of geographical and population diversity, long waits for elective care demand the capacity and commitment to scale up effective and sustainable models of care delivery across the country. Profound health inequities experienced by Indigenous populations and some vulnerable groups also require coordinated action on the social determinants of health if these inequities are to be effectively addressed. Achievement of the high aspirations of Medicare's founders requires a renewal of the tripartite social contract between governments, health-care providers, and the public. Expansion of the publicly funded basket of services and coordinated effort to reduce variation in outcomes will hinge on more engaged roles for the federal government and the physician community than have existed in previous decades. Public engagement in system stewardship will also be crucial to achieve a high-quality system grounded in both evidence and the Canadian values of equity and solidarity.","[Martin, Danielle] Womens Coll Hosp, Toronto, ON M5S 1B2, Canada; [Martin, Danielle] Univ Toronto, Dept Family & Community Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Martin, Danielle; Marchildon, Gregory P.] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Miller, Ashley P.] Dalhousie Univ, Div Gen Internal Med, Dept Med, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Quesnel-Vallee, Amelie] McGill Univ, McGill Observ Hlth & Social Serv Reforms, Dept Epidemiol Biostat & Occupat Hlth, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Quesnel-Vallee, Amelie] McGill Univ, Dept Sociol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Caron, Nadine R.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Surg, Northern Med Program, Prince George, BC, Canada; [Caron, Nadine R.] Univ British Columbia, Ctr Excellence Indigenous Hlth, Prince George, BC, Canada; [Vissandjee, Bilkis] Univ Montreal, Sch Nursing, SHERPA Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Vissandjee, Bilkis] Univ Montreal, Publ Hlth Res Inst, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Marchildon, Gregory P.] Univ Regina, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, Regina, SK, Canada",,"Martin, D (corresponding author), Womens Coll Hosp, Toronto, ON M5S 1B2, Canada.",danielle.martin@wchospital.ca,,"Marchildon, Gregory/0000-0003-4898-2392",McGill Observatory on Health and Social Services Reforms; Canada Research Chair in Policies and Health Inequalities (AQ-V),McGill Observatory on Health and Social Services Reforms; Canada Research Chair in Policies and Health Inequalities (AQ-V),"We acknowledge funding from the McGill Observatory on Health and Social Services Reforms and from the Canada Research Chair in Policies and Health Inequalities (AQ-V) for maps developed by Tim Elrick and Ruilan Shi at the McGill Geographic Information Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.

Of new colorectal cancer diagnoses, 20% of patients have metastatic disease at presentation and another 25% who present with localized disease will later develop metastases. ObservationsColorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer mortality for men and women in the United States, with 53200 deaths projected in 2020. Among people diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer, approximately 70% to 75% of patients survive beyond 1 year, 30% to 35% beyond 3 years, and fewer than 20% beyond 5 years from diagnosis. The primary treatment for unresectable metastatic CRC is systemic therapy (cytotoxic chemotherapy, biologic therapy such as antibodies to cellular growth factors, immunotherapy, and their combinations.) Clinical trials completed in the past 5 years have demonstrated that tailoring treatment to the molecular and pathologic features of the tumor improves overall survival. Genomic profiling to detect somatic variants is important because it identifies the treatments that may be effective. For the 50% of patients with metastatic CRC with KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type tumors, cetuximab and panitumumab (monoclonal antibodies to the epithelial growth factor receptor [EGFR]), in combination with chemotherapy, can extend median survival by 2 to 4 months compared with chemotherapy alone. However, for the 35% to 40% of patients with KRAS or NRAS sequence variations (formerly termed mutations), effective targeted therapies are not yet available. For the 5% to 10% with BRAF V600E sequence variations, targeted combination therapy with BRAF and EGFR inhibitors extended overall survival to 9.3 months, compared to 5.9 months for those receiving standard chemotherapy. For the 5% with microsatellite instability (the presence of numerous insertions or deletions at repetitive DNA units) or mismatch repair deficiency, immunotherapy may be used in the first or subsequent line and has improved treatment outcomes with a median overall survival of 31.4 months in previously treated patients. Conclusions and RelevanceAdvances in molecular profiling of metastatic CRC facilitate the ability to direct treatments to the biologic features of the tumor for specific patient subsets. Although cures remain uncommon, more patients can anticipate extended survival. Genomic profiling allows treatment selection so that more patients derive benefit and fewer are exposed to toxicity from ineffective therapies. This narrative review summarizes treatment options for patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer, focusing on the importance of genomic profiling to identify KRAS/NRAS/BRAF variants to guide immunotherapy.","[Biller, Leah H.; Schrag, Deborah] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Div Gastrointestinal Oncol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Biller, Leah H.; Schrag, Deborah] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Med Oncol, 450 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Schrag, Deborah] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Div Populat Sci, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,"Schrag, D (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Dept Med Oncol, 450 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",deb_schrag@dfci.harvard.edu,,,,,,,80,105,106,89,157,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Almost always, primary hyperparathyroidism is due to a benign overgrowth of parathyroid tissue either as a single gland (80% of cases) or as a multiple gland disorder (15-20% of cases). Primary hyperparathyroidism is generally discovered when asymptomatic but the disease always has the potential to become symptomatic, resulting in bone loss and kidney stones. In countries where biochemical screening tests are not common, symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism tends to predominate. Another variant of primary hyperparathyroidism has been described in which the serum calcium concentration is within normal range but parathyroid hormone is elevated in the absence of any obvious cause. Primary hyperparathyroidism can be cured by removal of the parathyroid gland or glands but identification of patients who are best advised to have surgery requires consideration of the guidelines that are regularly updated. Recommendations for patients who do not undergo parathyroid surgery include monitoring of serum calcium concentrations and bone density.","[Bilezikian, John P.; Bandeira, Leonardo; Cusano, Natalie E.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Div Endocrinol, New York, NY USA; [Bandeira, Leonardo] Univ Pernambuco, Sch Med, Brazilian Minist Hlth, Div Endocrinol & Diabet,Agamenon Magalhaes Hosp, Recife, PE, Brazil; [Khan, Aliya] McMaster Univ, Div Endocrinol, Hamilton, ON, Canada",,"Bilezikian, JP (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Med, New York, NY 10032 USA.",jpb2@columbia.edu,"FARIAS, LEONARDO BANDEIRA E/AAK-4964-2020","FARIAS, LEONARDO BANDEIRA E/0000-0003-1035-4921",,,,,137,204,218,10,53,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,JAN 13,2018,391,10116,,,,,168,178,,10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31430-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31430-7,,,11,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,FT0EG,28923463,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000422793400031,View Full Record in Web of Science,67520,0,128,29,89,42,131,123,36,109,131,83,45,89,109,50,97

Prior studies estimated that approximately 30% of health care spending may be considered waste. Despite efforts to reduce overtreatment, improve care, and address overpayment, it is likely that substantial waste in US health care spending remains. ObjectivesTo estimate current levels of waste in the US health care system in 6 previously developed domains and to report estimates of potential savings for each domain. EvidenceA search of peer-reviewed and gray literature from January 2012 to May 2019 focused on the 6 waste domains previously identified by the Institute of Medicine and Berwick and Hackbarth: failure of care delivery, failure of care coordination, overtreatment or low-value care, pricing failure, fraud and abuse, and administrative complexity. For each domain, available estimates of waste-related costs and data from interventions shown to reduce waste-related costs were recorded, converted to annual estimates in 2019 dollars for national populations when necessary, and combined into ranges or summed as appropriate. FindingsThe review yielded 71 estimates from 54 unique peer-reviewed publications, government-based reports, and reports from the gray literature. Computations yielded the following estimated ranges of total annual cost of waste: failure of care delivery, $102.4 billion to $165.7 billion; failure of care coordination, $27.2 billion to $78.2 billion; overtreatment or low-value care, $75.7 billion to $101.2 billion; pricing failure, $230.7 billion to $240.5 billion; fraud and abuse, $58.5 billion to $83.9 billion; and administrative complexity, $265.6 billion. The estimated annual savings from measures to eliminate waste were as follows: failure of care delivery, $44.4 billion to $93.3 billion; failure of care coordination, $29.6 billion to $38.2 billion; overtreatment or low-value care, $12.8 billion to $28.6 billion; pricing failure, $81.4 billion to $91.2 billion; and fraud and abuse, $22.8 billion to $30.8 billion. No studies were identified that focused on interventions targeting administrative complexity. The estimated total annual costs of waste were $760 billion to $935 billion and savings from interventions that address waste were $191 billion to $282 billion. Conclusions and RelevanceIn this review based on 6 previously identified domains of health care waste, the estimated cost of waste in the US health care system ranged from $760 billion to $935 billion, accounting for approximately 25% of total health care spending, and the projected potential savings from interventions that reduce waste, excluding savings from administrative complexity, ranged from $191 billion to $282 billion, representing a potential 25% reduction in the total cost of waste. Implementation of effective measures to eliminate waste represents an opportunity reduce the continued increases in US health care expenditures. This Special Communication uses a systematic literature review to update previous dollar estimates of waste in the US health care system attributable to failure of care delivery and coordination, low-value care, price inflation, fraud, and administrative complexity.","[Shrank, William H.; Rogstad, Teresa L.] Humana Inc, 500 W Main St, Louisville, KY 40202 USA; [Parekh, Natasha] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Div Gen Internal Med, Pittsburgh, PA USA",,"Shrank, WH (corresponding author), Humana Inc, 500 W Main St, Louisville, KY 40202 USA.",wshrank@humana.com,,,,,,,61,275,274,19,82,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Epilepsy, a condition characterised by spontaneous recurrent seizures, is common in older adults (aged >65 years) and yet has received comparatively little attention in this age group. In this Review, we evaluate the underlying causes of epilepsy in older people, explore difficulties in establishing a diagnosis of epilepsy in this population, discuss appropriate antiseizure medications, and evaluate potential surgical treatment options. We consider cognitive, psychological, and psychosocial comorbidities and the effect that epilepsy might have on an older person's broader social or care network in high-income versus middle-income and low-income countries. We emphasise the need for clinical trials to be more inclusive of older people with epilepsy to help inform therapeutic decision making and discuss whether measures to improve vascular risk factors might be an important strategy to reduce the probability of developing epilepsy.","[Sen, Arjune] John Radcliffe Hosp, Oxford Epilepsy Res Grp, Natl Inst Hlth Res, Oxford Biomed Res Ctr,Nuffield Dept Clin Neurosci, Oxford, England; [Jette, Nathalie] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Neurol, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Jette, Nathalie] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Populat Hlth Sci & Policy, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Husain, Masud] Univ Oxford, Dept Psychol, Oxford, England; [Sander, Josemir W.] Univ Coll London Hosp, Natl Inst Hlth Res, Biomed Res Ctr, UCL Queen Sq Inst Neurol, London, England; [Sander, Josemir W.] Chalfont Ctr Epilepsy, Gerrards Cross, England; [Sander, Josemir W.] SEIN, Heemstede, Netherlands",,"Sen, A (corresponding author), John Radcliffe Hosp, Oxford Epilepsy Res Grp, Nuffield Dept Clin Neurosci, Oxford OX3 9DU, England.",arjune.sen@ndcn.ox.ac.uk,"Sander, Ley/C-1576-2008; Husain, Masud/C-2074-2008","Sander, Ley/0000-0001-6041-9661; Husain, Masud/0000-0002-6850-9255","National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital; NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre from the UK Department of Health's Research Centres funding scheme; Bludhorn Professor of International Medicine Chair; NINDS; Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute; Wellcome Trust; Dr Marvin Weil Epilepsy Research Fund; UK Epilepsy Society; Christelijke Vereniging voor de Verpleging van Lijders aan Epilepsie","National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital; NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre from the UK Department of Health's Research Centres funding scheme; Bludhorn Professor of International Medicine Chair; NINDS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute(Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute - PCORI); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome TrustEuropean Commission); Dr Marvin Weil Epilepsy Research Fund; UK Epilepsy Society; Christelijke Vereniging voor de Verpleging van Lijders aan Epilepsie","This Review was supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital and the NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, which receive a proportion of funding from the UK Department of Health's Research Centres funding scheme.

Given the rapid pace of scientific discovery and clinical data generated by the large number of people rapidly infected by SARS-CoV-2, clinicians need accurate evidence regarding effective medical treatments for this infection. Observations No proven effective therapies for this virus currently exist. The rapidly expanding knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 virology provides a significant number of potential drug targets. The most promising therapy is remdesivir. Remdesivir has potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, but it is not US Food and Drug Administration approved and currently is being tested in ongoing randomized trials. Oseltamivir has not been shown to have efficacy, and corticosteroids are currently not recommended. Current clinical evidence does not support stopping angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest global public health crisis of this generation and, potentially, since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918. The speed and volume of clinical trials launched to investigate potential therapies for COVID-19 highlight both the need and capability to produce high-quality evidence even in the middle of a pandemic. No therapies have been shown effective to date.","[Sanders, James M.; Monogue, Marguerite L.] Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Pharm, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Sanders, James M.; Monogue, Marguerite L.; Cutrell, James B.] Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis & Geog Med, 5323 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Jodlowski, Tomasz Z.] VA North Texas Hlth Care Syst, Serv Pharm, Dallas, TX USA",,"Sanders, JM (corresponding author), Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis & Geog Med, 5323 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",james.cutrell@utsouthwestern.edu,"Sanders, James/ABG-2783-2021; Lin, Chen/AFV-2163-2022; Monogue, Marguerite/AAV-1234-2020; Dore, Celina/AAG-9342-2019; Monogue, Marguerite L/I-1668-2016",,,,,,93,1429,1475,54,223,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Designed to be given in fixed doses without routine monitoring, direct oral anticoagulants have a lower propensity for food and drug interactions than do vitamin K antagonists, and in randomised controlled trials involving around 250 000 patients, they were at least as effective for prevention and treatment of thrombosis and were associated with a lower risk of life-threatening bleeding. The absolute benefits of direct oral anticoagulants over vitamin K antagonists are modest; however, guidelines recommend them in preference to vitamin K antagonists for most indications because of their ease of use and superior safety. The greatest benefits of direct oral anticoagulants are likely to be in patients who were previously deemed unsuitable for vitamin K antagonist therapy. The emergence of generic preparations is expected to further increase the uptake of direct oral anticoagulants, particularly in countries where they are currently not widely used because of cost. Direct oral anticoagulants are contraindicated in patients with mechanical heart valves and should be used with caution or avoided in patients with advanced kidney or liver disease. In this Therapeutics paper, we review the pharmacology of direct oral anticoagulants, summarise the evidence that led to their approval and incorporation into treatment guidelines, and explore key unresolved issues. We also briefly discuss future perspectives for the development of oral anticoagulants.","[Chan, Noel; Eikelboom, John W.] Thrombosis & Atherosclerosis Res Inst, Hamilton, ON L8L 2X2, Canada; [Chan, Noel; Eikelboom, John W.] Populat Hlth Res Inst, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Chan, Noel; Eikelboom, John W.] Hamilton Gen Hosp, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Chan, Noel; Eikelboom, John W.] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Sobieraj-Teague, Magdalena] Flinders Med Ctr, Adelaide, SA, Australia",,"Chan, N (corresponding author), Thrombosis & Atherosclerosis Res Inst, Hamilton, ON L8L 2X2, Canada.",noel.chan@taari.ca,"Eikelboom, John/AAG-6117-2019","Eikelboom, John/0000-0003-4126-1285; Chan, Noel/0000-0001-9491-6172",,,,,70,33,34,4,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,NOV 28,2020,396,10264,,,,,1767,1776,,,,,,10,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,OZ0XE,33248499,,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000594658800031,View Full Record in Web of Science,68808,0,53,34,48,68,52,61,18,16,69,60,50,50,17,56,16

In this Review, we discuss the current literature, which shows that despite what might be inferred during training, physicians are not immune to mental illness, with between a quarter and a third reporting increased symptoms of mental ill health. Physicians, particularly female physicians, are at an increased risk of suicide. An emerging consensus exists that some aspects of physician training, working conditions, and organisational support are unacceptable. Changes in medical training and health systems, and the additional strain of working through a pandemic, might have amplified these problems. A new evidence-informed framework for how individual and organisational interventions can be used in an integrated manner in medical schools, in health-care settings, and by professional colleagues is proposed. New initiatives are required at each of these levels, with an urgent need for organisational-level interventions, to better protect the mental health and wellbeing of physicians.","[Harvey, Samuel B.; Petrie, Katherine; Strudwick, Jessica; Gayed, Aimee] Univ New South Wales, Black Dog Inst, Fac Med, Randwick, NSW, Australia; [Epstein, Ronald M.] Univ Rochester, Sch Med & Dent, Dept Family Med, Ctr Commun & Dispar Res, Rochester, NY USA; [Glozier, Nicholas] Univ Sydney, Fac Med & Hlth, Sydney Sch Med, Cent Clin Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Petrie, Katherine; Dean, Kimberlie] Univ New South Wales, UNSW Med, Sch Psychiat, Kensington, NSW, Australia; [Dean, Kimberlie] Justice Hlth & Forens Mental Hlth Network, Matraville, NSW, Australia; [Henderson, Max] Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Hlth Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",,"Harvey, SB (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Black Dog Inst, Randwick, NSW 2031, Australia.",s.harvey@unsw.edu.au,,"Petrie, Katherine/0000-0002-6285-8518; Harvey, Samuel/0000-0001-9580-3743; Glozier, Nick/0000-0002-0476-9146",,,,,130,11,11,26,31,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,SEP 4,2021,398,10303,,,,,920,930,,,,,,11,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,UL4MW,34481571,,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000692628000025,View Full Record in Web of Science,69410,0,48,92,33,18,30,4,36,56,97,80,85,89,18,97,130

This narrative review summarises the findings of 69 prospective longitudinal studies to inform practitioners and policy makers about physical punishment's outcomes. Our review identified seven key themes. First, physical punishment consistently predicts increases in child behaviour problems over time. Second, physical punishment is not associated with positive outcomes over time. Third, physical punishment increases the risk of involvement with child protective services. Fourth, the only evidence of children eliciting physical punishment is for externalising behaviour. Fifth, physical punishment predicts worsening behaviour over time in quasi-experimental studies. Sixth, associations between physical punishment and detrimental child outcomes are robust across child and parent characteristics. Finally, there is some evidence of a dose-response relationship. The consistency of these findings indicates that physical punishment is harmful to children and that policy remedies are warranted.","[Heilmann, Anja; Mehay, Anita; Watt, Richard G.; Kelly, Yvonne] UCL, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Durrant, Joan E.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [van Turnhout, Jillian] Royal Coll Phys Ireland, Fac Paediat, Dublin, Ireland; [Gershoff, Elizabeth T.] Univ Texas Austin, Populat Res Ctr, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Gershoff, Elizabeth T.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Human Dev & Family Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,"Heilmann, A (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, London WC1E 6BT, England.",anja.heilmann@ucl.ac.uk,,"Mehay, Anita/0000-0001-7329-9056; Watt, Richard/0000-0001-6229-8584",Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in the USA [P2CHD042849]; UK Economic and Social Research Council [ES/R008930/1]; ESRC [ES/R008930/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in the USA; UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),ETG is supported by grant P2CHD042849 from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in the USA.

All hip replacements would eventually fail if in situ long enough and it is important that patients understand when this might happen. We aimed to answer the question: how long does a hip replacement last? Methods We did a systematic review and meta-analysis with a search of MEDLINE and Embase from the start of records to Sept 12, 2017. We included articles reporting 15-year survival of primary, conventional total hip replacement constructs in patients with osteoarthritis. We extracted survival and implant data and used all-cause construct survival as the primary outcome. We also reviewed reports of national joint replacement registries, and extracted data for a separate analysis. In the meta-analyses, we weighted each series and calculated a pooled survival estimate for each source of data. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018085642). Findings We identified 140 eligible articles reporting 150 series, and included 44 of these series (13 212 total hip placements). National joint replacement registries from Australia and Finland provided data for 92 series (215 676 total hip replacements). The 25-year pooled survival of hip replacements from case series was 77.6% (95% CI 76.0-79.2) and from joint replacement registries was 57.9% (95% CI 57.1-58.7).

Health-care policy makers and providers have uncertainties about the optimal ways to organise and provide care. For this Series paper, we have developed recommendations for practice from literature reviews, appraisal of guidelines, and a UK-wide consensus conference that was held in December, 2019. Caregivers should individualise care according to the clinical needs and preferences of women and their partners. We define a minimum set of investigations and treatments to be offered to couples who have had recurrent miscarriages, and urge health-care policy makers and providers to make them universally available. The essential investigations include measurements of lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, thyroid function, and a transvaginal pelvic ultrasound scan. The key treatments to consider are first trimester progesterone administration, levothyroxine in women with subclinical hypothyroidism, and the combination of aspirin and heparin in women with antiphospholipid antibodies. Appropriate screening and care for mental health issues and future obstetric risks, particularly preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and stillbirth, will need to be incorporated into the care pathway for couples with a history of recurrent miscarriage. We suggest health-care services structure care using a graded model in which women are offered online health-care advice and support, care in a nurse or midwifery-led clinic, and care in a medical consultant-led clinic, according to clinical needs.","[Coomarasamy, Arri; Dhillon-Smith, Rima K.; Papadopoulou, Argyro; Kaur, Rajinder; Pickering, Oonagh; Devall, Adam J.; Gallos, Ioannis D.] Univ Birmingham, Tommys Natl Ctr Miscarriage Res, Inst Metab & Syst Res, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Al-Memar, Maya; Bennett, Phillip R.; Regan, Lesley; Rai, Raj; Bourne, Tom] Imperial Coll London, Tommys Natl Ctr Miscarriage Res, London, England; [Brewin, Jane] Tommys Char, Laurence Pountney Hill, London, England; [Abrahams, Vikki M.] Yale Univ, Dept Obstet Gynecol & Reprod Sci, New Haven, CT USA; [Maheshwari, Abha] Aberdeen Ctr Reprod Med, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Christiansen, Ole B.] Aalborg Univ Hosp, Dept Obstet & Gynaecol, Ctr Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Western Denmark, Aalborg, Denmark; [Stephenson, Mary D.] Univ Illinois, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Program, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Goddijn, Mariette] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, Ctr Reprod Med, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Oladapo, Olufemi T.] WHO, Dept Sexual & Reprod Hlth & Res, UNDP UNFPA UNICEF WHO World Bank Special Programm, Geneva, Switzerland; [Wijeyaratne, Chandrika N.] Univ Colombo, Dept Reprod Med, Colombo, Sri Lanka; [Bick, Debra] Univ Warwick, Warwick Clin Trials Unit, Warwick, England; [Shehata, Hassan] Epsom & St Helier Univ Hosp NHS Trust, Epsom Gen Hosp, Epsom, Surrey, England; [Small, Rachel] Univ Hosp Birmingham NHS Fdn Trust, Birmingham Heartlands Hosp, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Brosens, Jan J.; Quenby, Siobhan] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Div Biomed Sci, Warwick, England; [Brosens, Jan J.; Quenby, Siobhan] Univ Hosp Coventry & Warwickshire NHS Trust, Tommys Natl Ctr Miscarriage Res, Coventry, W Midlands, England",,"Coomarasamy, A (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Inst Metab & Syst Res, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",a.coomarasamy@bham.ac.uk,"Bourne, Tom/I-6478-2012; Papadopoulou, Argyro/AAR-1380-2020; Devall, Adam/AAC-9646-2022","Bourne, Tom/0000-0003-1421-6059; Papadopoulou, Argyro/0000-0001-9409-8608; Goddijn, Mariette/0000-0001-9928-9673; Bennett, Phillip/0000-0002-6253-4919; Quenby, Siobhan/0000-0003-3221-5471; Gallos, Ioannis/0000-0002-2766-358X",Tommy's Charity; Wellcome Trust Investigator Award [212233/Z/18/Z],Tommy's Charity; Wellcome Trust Investigator Award(Wellcome Trust),The Tommy's Charity funds the Tommy's National Centre for Miscarriage Research.

Several pharmacological agents are available to lower fracture risk, either by reducing bone resorption or by stimulating bone formation. Bisphosphonates are the most widely used anti-resorptives, reducing bone turnover markers to low premenopausal concentrations and reducing fracture rates (vertebral by 50-70%, non-vertebral by 20-30%, and hip by similar to 40%). Bisphosphonates bind avidly to bone mineral and have an offset of effect measured in months to years. Long term, continuous use of oral bisphosphonates is usually interspersed with drug holidays of 1-2 years, to minimise the risk of atypical femoral fractures. Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody against RANKL that potently inhibits osteoclast development and activity. Denosumab is administered by subcutaneous injection every 6 months. Anti-fracture effects of denosumab are similar to those of the bisphosphonates, but there is a pronounced loss of anti-resorptive effect from 7 months after the last injection, which can result in clusters of rebound vertebral fractures. Two classes of anabolic drugs are now available to stimulate bone formation. Teriparatide and abaloparatide both target the parathyroid hormone-1 receptor, and are given by daily subcutaneous injection for up to 2 years. Romosozumab is an anti-sclerostin monoclonal antibody that stimulates bone formation and inhibits resorption. Romosozumab is given as monthly subcutaneous injections for 1 year. Head-to-head studies suggest that anabolic agents have greater anti-fracture efficacy and produce larger increases in bone density than anti-resorptive drugs. The effects of anabolic agents are transient, so transition to anti-resorptive drugs is required. The optimal strategy for cycling anabolics, anti-resorptives, and off-treatment periods remains to be determined.","[Reid, Ian R.] Univ Auckland, Dept Med, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Reid, Ian R.] Auckland Dist Hlth Board, Auckland, New Zealand; [Billington, Emma O.] Univ Calgary, Cumming Sch Med, Div Endocrinol & Metab, Calgary, AB, Canada",,"Reid, IR (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, New Zealand.",i.reid@auckland.ac.nz,,,,,,,100,5,5,17,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,MAR,2022,399,10329,,,,,1080,1092,,,,,,13,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,ZS1JF,35279261,,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000768227500028,View Full Record in Web of Science,70224,0,57,39,22,78,27,44,49,3,93,30,88,47,38,20,61

Replacement therapy has been the cornerstone of the management of haemophilia, aiming to reduce the mortality and morbidity of chronic crippling arthropathy. Frequent intravenous injections are burdensome and costly for patients, consequently with poor adherence and restricted access to therapy for many patients worldwide. Bioengineered clotting factors with enhanced pharmacokinetic profiles can reduce the burden of treatment. However, replacement therapy is associated with a risk for inhibitor development that adversely affects bleeding prevention and outcomes. Novel molecules that are subcutaneously delivered provide effective prophylaxis in the presence or absence of inhibitors, either substituting for the procoagulant function of clotting factors (eg, emicizumab) or targeting the natural inhibitors of coagulation (ie, antithrombin, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, or activated protein C). The ultimate goal of haemophilia treatment would be a phenotypical cure achievable with gene therapy, currently under late phase clinical investigation.","[Mancuso, Maria Elisa] IRCCS Humanitas Clin & Res Ctr, Ctr Thrombosis & Hemorrhag Dis, I-20089 Milan, Italy; [Mahlangu, Johnny N.] Univ Witwatersrand, Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Acad Hosp, Fac Hlth Sci, Natl Hlth Lab Serv, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Pipe, Steven W.] Univ Michigan, Pediat & Pathol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Mancuso, ME (corresponding author), IRCCS Humanitas Clin & Res Ctr, Ctr Thrombosis & Hemorrhag Dis, I-20089 Milan, Italy.",mariaelisa_mancuso@libero.it,"Mahlangu, Johnny Ndoni/H-7558-2019","Mahlangu, Johnny Ndoni/0000-0001-5781-7669",,,,,93,26,26,5,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,FEB 13,2021,397,10274,,,,,630,640,,10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32722-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32722-7,,FEB 2021,11,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,QL2TN,33460559,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000620934000027,View Full Record in Web of Science,70246,0,40,42,39,54,74,2,17,52,51,48,76,16,1,21,49

We investigated the effect of parental migration on the health of left behind-children and adolescents in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PsychINFO, Global Index Medicus, Scopus, and Popline from inception to April 27, 2017, without language restrictions, for observational studies investigating the effects of parental migration on nutrition, mental health, unintentional injuries, infectious disease, substance use, unprotected sex, early pregnancy, and abuse in left-behind children (aged 0-19 years) in LMICs. We excluded studies in which less than 50% of participants were aged 0-19 years, the mean or median age of participants was more than 19 years, fewer than 50% of parents had migrated for more than 6 months, or the mean or median duration of migration was less than 6 months. We screened studies using systematic review software and extracted summary estimates from published reports independently. The main outcomes were risk and prevalence of health outcomes, including nutrition (stunting, wasting, underweight, overweight and obesity, low birthweight, and anaemia), mental health (depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, conduct disorders, self-harm, and suicide), unintentional injuries, substance use, abuse, and infectious disease. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RRs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) using random-effects models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017064871. Findings Our search identified 10 284 records, of which 111 studies were included for analysis, including a total of 264 967 children (n=106 167 left-behind children and adolescents; n=158 800 children and adolescents of non-migrant parents). 91 studies were done in China and focused on effects of internal labour migration. Compared with children of non-migrants, left-behind children had increased risk of depression and higher depression scores (RR 1.52 [95% CI 1.27-1.82]; SMD 0.16 [0.10-0.21]), anxiety (RR 1.85 [1.36-2.53]; SMD 0.18 [0.11-0.26]), suicidal ideation (RR 1.70 [1.28-2.26]), conduct disorder (SMD 0.16 [0.04-0.28]), substance use (RR 1.24 [1.00-1.52]), wasting (RR 1.13 [1.02-1.24]) and stunting (RR 1.12 [1.00-1.26]). No differences were identified between left-behind children and children of non-migrants for other nutrition outcomes, unintentional injury, abuse, or diarrhoea. No studies reported outcomes for other infectious diseases, self-harm, unprotected sex, or early pregnancy. Study quality varied across the included studies, with 43% of studies at high or unclear risk of bias across five or more domains. Interpretation Parental migration is detrimental to the health of left-behind children and adolescents, with no evidence of any benefit. Policy makers and health-care professionals need to take action to improve the health of these young people. Copyright (c) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) involves use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) daily or before and after sex to decrease risk of acquiring HIV infection. OBJECTIVE To synthesize the evidence on the benefits and harms of PrEP, instruments for predicting incident HIV infection, and PrEP adherence to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force. DATA SOURCES Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and EMBASE through June 2018, with surveillance through January 2019. STUDY SELECTION English-language placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials of oral PrEP with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate monotherapy; studies on the diagnostic accuracy of instruments for predicting incident HIV infection; and studies on PrEP adherence. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Dual review of titles and abstracts, full-text articles, study quality, and data abstraction. Data were pooled using the Dersimonian and Laird random-effects model for effects of PrEP on HIV infection, mortality, and harms. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES HIV acquisition, mortality, and harms; adherence to PrEP; and diagnostic test accuracy and discrimination. RESULTS Fourteen RCTs (N = 18 837), 8 observational studies (N = 3884), and 7 studies of diagnostic accuracy (N = 32 279) were included. PrEP was associated with decreased risk of HIV infection vs placebo or no PrEP after 4 months to 4 years (11 trials; relative risk [RR], 0.46 [95% CI, 0.33-0.66]; I-2 = 67%; absolute risk reduction [ARD], -2.0%[95% CI, -2.8% to -1.2%]). Greater adherence was associated with greater efficacy (RR with adherence >= 70%, 0.27 [95% CI, 0.19-0.39]; I-2 = 0%) in 6 trials. PrEP was associated with an increased risk of renal adverse events (12 trials; RR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.18-1.75]; I-2 = 0%; ARD, 0.56%[95% CI, 0.09%-1.04%]) and gastrointestinal adverse events (12 trials; RR, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.26-2.11]; I-2 = 43%; ARD, 1.95%[95% CI, 0.48%-3.43%]); most adverse events were mild and reversible. Instruments for predicting incident HIV infection had moderate discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.49-0.72) and require further validation. Adherence to PrEP in the United States in men who have sex with men varied widely (22%-90%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In adults at increased risk of HIV infection, PrEP with oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate monotherapy or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine was associated with decreased risk of acquiring HIV infection compared with placebo or no PrEP, although effectiveness decreased with suboptimal adherence.","[Chou, Roger; Dana, Tracy; Bougatsos, Christina; Grusing, Sara] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Med Informat & Clin Epidemiol, Pacific Northwest Evidence Based Practice Ctr, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd,Mail Code BICC, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Chou, Roger; Evans, Christopher; Korthuis, P.

This Series paper focuses on the direct (due to violence) and indirect health effects of armed conflict on women and children (including adolescents) worldwide. We estimate that nearly 36 million children and 16 million women were displaced in 2017, on the basis of international databases of refugees and internally displaced populations. From geospatial analyses we estimate that the number of non-displaced women and children living dangerously close to armed conflict (within 50 km) increased from 185 million women and 250 million children in 2000, to 265 million women and 368 million children in 2017. Women's and children's mortality risk from non-violent causes increases substantially in response to nearby conflict, with more intense and more chronic conflicts leading to greater mortality increases. More than 10 million deaths in children younger than 5 years can be attributed to conflict between 1995 and 2015 globally. Women of reproductive ages living near high intensity conflicts have three times higher mortality than do women in peaceful settings. Current research provides fragmentary evidence about how armed conflict indirectly affects the survival chances of women and children through malnutrition, physical injuries, infectious diseases, poor mental health, and poor sexual and reproductive health, but major systematic evidence is sparse, hampering the design and implementation of essential interventions for mitigating the harms of armed conflicts.","[Bendavid, Eran] Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Div Primary Care & Populat Hlth, Ctr Populat Hlth Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wise, Paul H.] Stanford Univ, Dept Pediat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Heft-Neal, Sam] Stanford Univ, Ctr Food Secur & Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Boerma, Ties] Univ Manitoba, Ctr Global Publ Hlth, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Akseer, Nadia; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.] Hosp Sick Children SickKids, Ctr Global Child Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Langer, Ana] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Women & Hlth Initiat, Boston, MA USA; [Malembaka, Espoir Bwenge] Univ Catholique Bukavu, Fac Med, Ecole Reg Sante Publ, Bukavu, Rep Congo; [Okiro, Emelda A.] Kenya Govt Med Res Ctr, Populat Hlth Unit, WellcomeTrust Res Programme, Nairobi, Kenya; [Okiro, Emelda A.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Clin Med, Ctr Trop Med & Global Hlth, Oxford, England; [Akseer, Nadia; Black, Robert E.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Inst Int Programs, Baltimore, MD USA; [Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.] Aga Khan Univ, Ctr Excellence Women & Child Hlth, Karachi, Pakistan; [Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.] Aga Khan Univ, Inst Global Hlth & Dev, Karachi, Pakistan",,"Bendavid, E (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Div Primary Care & Populat Hlth, Ctr Populat Hlth Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",ebd@stanford.edu,"Bhutta, Zulfiqar/L-7822-2015","Bhutta, Zulfiqar/0000-0003-0637-599X; Okiro, Emelda/0000-0001-9543-8360; Malembaka, Espoir Bwenge/0000-0001-9306-0253","Centre for Global Child Health at the Hospital for Sick Children; Countdown to 2030 for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health","Centre for Global Child Health at the Hospital for Sick Children; Countdown to 2030 for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health","The analysis was supported by a grant from the Centre for Global Child Health at the Hospital for Sick Children, which was partly supported by the Countdown to 2030 for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health.

OBJECTIVE To inform the US Preventive Services Task Force by modeling the benefits and harms of various cervical cancer screening strategies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Microsimulation model of a hypothetical cohort of women initiating screening at age 21 years. EXPOSURES Screening with cytology, hrHPV testing, and cytology and hrHPV cotesting, varying age to switch from cytology to hrHPV testing or cotesting (25, 27, 30 years), rescreening interval (3, 5 years), and triage options for hrHPV-positive results (16/18 genotype, cytology testing). Current guidelines-based screening strategies comprised cytology alone every 3 years starting at age 21 years, with or without a switch to cytology and hrHPV cotesting every 5 years from ages 30 to 65 years. Complete adherence for all 19 strategies was assumed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Lifetime number of tests, colposcopies, disease detection, false-positive results, cancer cases and deaths, life-years, and efficiency ratios expressing the trade-off of harms (ie, colposcopies, tests) vs benefits (life-years gained, cancer cases averted). Efficient strategies were those that yielded more benefit and less harm than another strategy or a lower harm to benefit ratio than a strategy with less harms. RESULTS Compared with no screening, all modeled cervical cancer screening strategies were estimated to result in substantial reductions in cancer cases and deaths and gains in life-years. The effectiveness of screening across the different strategies was estimated to be similar, with primary hrHPV-based and alternative cotesting strategies having slightly higher effectiveness and greater harms than current guidelines-based cytology testing. For example, cervical cancer deaths associated with the guidelines-based strategies ranged from 0.30 to 0.76 deaths per 1000 women, whereas new strategies involving primary hrHPV testing or cotesting were associated with fewer cervical cancer deaths, ranging from 0.23 to 0.29 deaths per 1000 women. In all analyses, primary hrHPV testing strategies occurring at 5-year intervals were efficient. For example, 5-year primary hrHPV testing (cytology triage) based on switching from cytology to hrHPV screening at ages 30 years, 27 years, and 25 years had ratios per life-year gained of 73, 143, and 195 colposcopies, respectively. In contrast, strategies involving 3-year hrHPV testing had much higher ratios, ranging from 2188 to 3822 colposcopies per life-year gained. In most analyses, strategies involving cotesting were not efficient. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this microsimulation modeling study, it was estimated that primary hrHPV screening may represent a reasonable balance of harms and benefits when performed every 5 years. Switching from cytology to hrHPV testing at age 30 years yielded the most efficient harm to benefit ratio when using colposcopy as a proxy for harms.","[Kim, Jane J.; Burger, Emily A.; Regan, Catherine; Sy, Stephen] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Ctr Hlth Decis Sci, 718 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Burger, Emily A.] Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, Oslo, Norway",,"Kim, JJ (corresponding author), Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Ctr Hlth Decis Sci, 718 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",jkim@hsph.harvard.edu,,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA-290-2012-00015-I]; USPSTF; National Cancer Institute grant [U01CA199334]; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE [U01CA199334] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services; USPSTF; National Cancer Institute grant(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI))","This research was funded under contract HHSA-290-2012-00015-I, Task Order 6, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the USPSTF.

However, the death rate is 11.0 deaths per 100000 person-years because the prognosis of pancreatic cancer is poor. Although its incidence is low, pancreatic cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death in the United States. Because of the increasing incidence of pancreatic cancer, along with improvements in early detection and treatment of other types of cancer, it is estimated that pancreatic cancer may soon become the second-leading cause of cancer death in the United States. ObjectiveTo update the 2004 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for pancreatic cancer. Evidence ReviewThe USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for pancreatic cancer, the diagnostic accuracy of screening tests for pancreatic cancer, and the benefits and harms of treatment of screen-detected or asymptomatic pancreatic cancer. FindingsThe USPSTF found no evidence that screening for pancreatic cancer or treatment of screen-detected pancreatic cancer improves disease-specific morbidity or mortality, or all-cause mortality. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the magnitude of the benefits of screening for pancreatic cancer in asymptomatic adults can be bounded as no greater than small. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the magnitude of the harms of screening for pancreatic cancer and treatment of screen-detected pancreatic cancer can be bounded as at least moderate. The USPSTF reaffirms its previous conclusion that the potential benefits of screening for pancreatic cancer in asymptomatic adults do not outweigh the potential harms. Conclusions and RecommendationThe USPSTF recommends against screening for pancreatic cancer in asymptomatic adults.

Uncontrolled inflammation leads to long-term complications, including fibrotic strictures, enteric fistulae, and intestinal neoplasia. Therefore, early and effective control of inflammation is of critical importance. Observations The optimal management approach for Crohn disease incorporates patient risk stratification, patient preference, and clinical factors in therapeutic decision-making. First-line therapy generally consists of steroids for rapid palliation of symptoms during initiation of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy. Other treatments may include monoclonal antibodies to IL-12/23 or integrin alpha 4 beta 7, immunomodulators, combination therapies, or surgery. Effective control of inflammation reduces the risk of penetrating complications (such as intra-abdominal abscesses and fistulae), although more than half of patients will develop complications that require surgery. Adverse reactions to therapy include antibody formation and infusion reactions, infections, and cancers associated with immune modulators and biologics and toxicity to the bone marrow and the liver. Both Crohn disease and corticosteroid use are associated with osteoporosis. Vaccinations to prevent infections, such as influenza, pneumonia, and herpes zoster, are important components of health maintenance for patients with Crohn disease, although live vaccines are contraindicated for patients receiving immune suppression therapy. Conclusions and Relevance The treatment of patients with Crohn disease depends on disease severity, patient risk stratification, patient preference, and clinical factors, including age of onset and penetrating complications, and includes treatment with steroids, monoclonal antibody therapies, immunomodulators, and surgery. Physicians should be familiar with the advantages and disadvantages of each therapy to best counsel their patients. This review discusses the diagnosis and management of Crohn disease, including the importance of disease severity and risk stratification when determining a treatment strategy, the importance of maintenance therapy, and the adverse effects of treatment options.","[Cushing, Kelly; Higgins, Peter D.

Evidence-based tools to aid the clinical diagnosis of viral vs bacterial conjunctivitis are lacking and may contribute to overprescribing of topical antibiotics. OBJECTIVE To determine the relative prevalence of viral vs bacterial conjunctivitis in adults and children, and to determine which symptoms or signs are suggestive of a viral vs bacterial etiology. DATA SOURCES A MEDLINE search (January 1946-March 2022) yielded 1891 articles. Included articles were rated using a quality score based on a modified Rational Clinical Examination grading system. Methodological quality levels 1 through 4 required a microbiological reference standard for diagnosis, whereas quality level 5 (the lowest quality) used a clinical reference standard for diagnosis. STUDY SELECTION Consecutive series of patients presenting with acute infectious conjunctivitis and case series of viral or bacterial conjunctivitis alone. Thirty-two studies were included in a meta-analysis to determine prevalence and diagnostic accuracy measures; 27 used a microbiological reference standard for diagnosis and 5 used a clinical reference standard for diagnosis. RESULTS In studies involving children (5 studies; 881 patients; mean age, 4.7 years [age range, 1 month-18 years]), the prevalence of bacterial conjunctivitis was higher than viral conjunctivitis (71% vs 16%, respectively, P =.01). In the only study of adults (n = 207 patients; mean age, 25.7 years), the prevalence of viral conjunctivitis was higher than bacterial conjunctivitis (78% vs 16%, respectively, P <.001). For the primary analysis of level 1 (n = 6) and level 2 (n = 5) studies (1725 patients total), the clinical findings that best distinguished a viral etiology for conjunctivitis from a bacterial etiology included pharyngitis (sensitivity range, 0.55-0.58; specificity range, 0.89-0.94; positive likelihood ratio [LR] range, 5.4-9.9), preauricular lymphadenopathy (sensitivity range, 0.17-0.31; specificity range, 0.93-0.94; positive LR range, 2.5-5.6), and contact with another person with red eye (sensitivity, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.14-0.22]; specificity, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.90-0.95]; positive LR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.6-3.7]). Mucopurulent ocular discharge (sensitivity, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.60-0.87); specificity, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.58-0.73]; positive LR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.7-2.6]) and otitis media (sensitivity, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.20-0.29]; specificity, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.85-0.94]; positive LR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.5-4.4]) were associated with the presence of bacterial conjunctivitis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this review, bacterial conjunctivitis was more common than viral conjunctivitis in children and viral conjunctivitis was more common than bacterial conjunctivitis in adults, although the prevalence estimates were based on limited evidence. Symptoms and signs associated with a higher likelihood of viral conjunctivitis in adults and children included concomitant pharyngitis, an enlarged preauricular node, and contact with another person with red eye, and signs associated with a higher likelihood of bacterial conjunctivitis included the presence of mucopurulent discharge and otitis media, but no single symptom or sign differentiated the 2 conditions with high certainty.","[Johnson, Davin; Liu, Daisy] Queens Univ, Dept Ophthalmol, 166 Brock St, Kingston, ON K7L 5G2, Canada; [Simel, David] Durham Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Durham, NC USA; [Simel, David] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Durham, NC 27706 USA",,"Johnson, D (corresponding author), Queens Univ, Dept Ophthalmol, 166 Brock St, Kingston, ON K7L 5G2, Canada.",davin.johnson@queensu.ca,,,Durham Center of Innovation to Accelerate Discovery and Practice Transformation at the Durham VA Health Care System,Durham Center of Innovation to Accelerate Discovery and Practice Transformation at the Durham VA Health Care System,Dr Simel's work was supported by the Durham Center of Innovation to Accelerate Discovery and Practice Transformation at the Durham VA Health Care System.,,55,0,0,0,0,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

This review summarizes current evidence regarding diagnosis and treatment of infertility. Observations Infertility is defined as the failure to achieve pregnancy after 12 months of regular unprotected sexual intercourse. Approximately 85% of infertile couples have an identifiable cause. The most common causes of infertility are ovulatory dysfunction, male factor infertility, and tubal disease. The remaining 15% of infertile couples have unexplained infertility. Lifestyle and environmental factors, such as smoking and obesity, can adversely affect fertility. Ovulatory disorders account for approximately 25% of infertility diagnoses; 70% of women with anovulation have polycystic ovary syndrome. Infertility can also be a marker of an underlying chronic disease associated with infertility. Clomiphene citrate, aromatase inhibitors such as letrozole, and gonadotropins are used to induce ovulation or for ovarian stimulation during in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles. Adverse effects of gonadotropins include multiple pregnancy (up to 36% of cycles, depending on specific therapy) and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (1%-5% of cycles), consisting of ascites, electrolyte imbalance, and hypercoagulability. For individuals presenting with anovulation, ovulation induction with timed intercourse is often the appropriate initial treatment choice. For couples with unexplained infertility, endometriosis, or mild male factor infertility, an initial 3 to 4 cycles of ovarian stimulation may be pursued; IVF should be considered if these approaches do not result in pregnancy. Because female fecundity declines with age, this factor should guide decision-making. Immediate IVF may be considered as a first-line treatment strategy in women older than 38 to 40 years. IVF is also indicated in cases of severe male factor infertility or untreated bilateral tubal factor. Conclusions and Relevance Approximately 1 in 8 women aged 15 to 49 years receive infertility services. Although success rates vary by age and diagnosis, accurate diagnosis and effective therapy along with shared decision-making can facilitate achievement of fertility goals in many couples treated for infertility. This review examines current evidence regarding the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of infertility.","[Carson, Sandra Ann; Kallen, Amanda N.] Yale Sch Med, Dept Obstet Gynecol & Reprod Sci, 330 Cedar St,FMB 337A, New Haven, CT 06510 USA",,"Carson, SA (corresponding author), Yale Sch Med, Dept Obstet Gynecol & Reprod Sci, 330 Cedar St,FMB 337A, New Haven, CT 06510 USA.",Sandra.carson@yale.edu,,,NICHD NIH HHS [K12 HD000849] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,96,24,24,14,26,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

OBJECTIVE To systematically review benefits and harms of primary care-relevant interventions to prevent perinatal depression, a major or minor depressive episode during pregnancy or up to 1 year after childbirth, to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, PubMED (for publisher-supplied records only), PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; surveillance through December 5, 2018. STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized controlled intervention studies of interventions (eg, behavior-based, antidepressants, dietary supplements) to prevent perinatal depression in general populations of pregnant and postpartum individuals or in those at increased risk of perinatal depression. Large cohort studies were considered for harms of antidepressant use only. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles and quality rated included studies. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the benefits of the interventions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Depression status; depression symptoms; maternal, infant, and child health outcomes. RESULTS Fifty studies (N = 22 385) that met inclusion criteria were identified. Counseling interventions were the most widely studied interventions. Compared with controls, counseling interventions were associated with a lower likelihood of onset of perinatal depression (pooled risk ratio [RR], 0.61 [95% CI, 0.47-0.78]; 17 RCTs [n = 3094]; I-2 = 39.0%). The absolute difference in the risk of perinatal depression ranged from 1.3% greater reduction in the control group to 31.8% greater reduction in the intervention group. Health system interventions showed a benefit in 3 studies (n = 5321) and had a pooled effect size similar to that of the counseling interventions, but the pooled effect was not statistically significant using a method appropriate for pooling a small number of studies (restricted maximum likelihood RR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.22-1.53]; n = 4738; I-2 = 66.3%; absolute risk reduction range, -3.1% to -13.1%). None of the behavior-based interventions reported on harms directly. A smaller percentage of participants prescribed sertraline had a depression recurrence compared with those prescribed placebo (7% vs 50%, P = .04) at 20 weeks postpartum in 1 very small RCT (n = 22 analyzed) but with an increased risk of adverse effects to the mother. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Counseling interventions can be effective in preventing perinatal depression, although most evidence was limited to women at increased risk for perinatal depression. A variety of other intervention approaches provided some evidence of effectiveness but lacked a robust evidence base and need further research.","[O'Connor, Elizabeth; Senger, Caitlyn A.; Henninger, Michelle L.; Coppola, Erin] Kaiser Permanente, Res Affiliates Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Ctr Hlth Res, 3800 N Interstate Ave, Portland, OR 97227 USA; [Gaynes, Bradley N.] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA",,"O'Connor, E (corresponding author), Kaiser Permanente, Res Affiliates Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Ctr Hlth Res, 3800 N Interstate Ave, Portland, OR 97227 USA.",Elizabeth.OConnor@kpchr.org,,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA-290-2015-00017-I]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract number HHSA-290-2015-00017-I, Task Order 3, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the USPSTF.",,75,99,101,9,40,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Parkinson's disease represents a fast-growing neurodegenerative condition; the rising prevalence worldwide resembles the many characteristics typically observed during a pandemic, except for an infectious cause. In most populations, 3-5% of Parkinson's disease is explained by genetic causes linked to known Parkinson's disease genes, thus representing monogenic Parkinson's disease, whereas 90 genetic risk variants collectively explain 16-36% of the heritable risk of non-monogenic Parkinson's disease. Additional causal associations include having a relative with Parkinson's disease or tremor, constipation, and being a non-smoker, each at least doubling the risk of Parkinson's disease. The diagnosis is clinically based; ancillary testing is reserved for people with an atypical presentation. Current criteria define Parkinson's disease as the presence of bradykinesia combined with either rest tremor, rigidity, or both. However, the clinical presentation is multifaceted and includes many non-motor symptoms. Prognostic counselling is guided by awareness of disease subtypes. Clinically manifest Parkinson's disease is preceded by a potentially long prodromal period. Presently, establishment of prodromal symptoms has no clinical implications other than symptom suppression, although recognition of prodromal parkinsonism will probably have consequences when disease-modifying treatments become available. Treatment goals vary from person to person, emphasising the need for personalised management. There is no reason to postpone symptomatic treatment in people developing disability due to Parkinson's disease. Levodopa is the most common medication used as first-line therapy. Optimal management should start at diagnosis and requires a multidisciplinary team approach, including a growing repertoire of non-pharmacological interventions. At present, no therapy can slow down or arrest the progression of Parkinson's disease, but informed by new insights in genetic causes and mechanisms of neuronal death, several promising strategies are being tested for disease-modifying potential. With the perspective of people with Parkinson's disease as a so-called red thread throughout this Seminar, we will show how personalised management of Parkinson's disease can be optimised.","[Bloem, Bastiaan R.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Ctr Expertise Parkinson & Movement Disorders, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, Med Ctr,Dept Neurol, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Okun, Michael S.] Univ Florida, Norman Fixel Inst Neurol Dis, Dept Neurol, Gainesville, FL USA; [Klein, Christine] Univ Lubeck, Inst Neurogenet, Lubeck, Germany; [Klein, Christine] Univ Lubeck, Dept Neurol, Lubeck, Germany; [Klein, Christine] Univ Hosp Schleswig Holstein, Lubeck, Germany",,"Bloem, BR (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Ctr Expertise Parkinson & Movement Disorders, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, Med Ctr,Dept Neurol, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands.",bas.bloem@radboudumc.nl,"Klein, Christine/AGK-8003-2022; Bloem, B.R./H-8013-2014","Bloem, B.R./0000-0002-6371-3337; Klein, Christine/0000-0003-2102-3431",Parkinson's Foundation; German Research Foundation [FOR2488],Parkinson's Foundation; German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The Radboud University Medical Centre of Expertise for Parkinson and Movement Disorders and the University of Florida Norman Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases were both supported by a centre of excellence grant from the Parkinson's Foundation.

In this Series paper, we focus on spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapies discussed within the framework of other invasive, minimally invasive, and non-invasive neuromodulation therapies. These therapies include deep brain and motor cortex stimulation, peripheral nerve stimulation, and the non-invasive treatments of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. SCS methods with electrical variables that differ from traditional SCS have been approved. Although methods devoid of paraesthesias (eg, high frequency) should theoretically allow for placebo-controlled trials, few have been done. There is low-to-moderate quality evidence that SCS is superior to reoperation or conventional medical management for failed back surgery syndrome, and conflicting evidence as to the superiority of traditional SCS over sham stimulation or between different SCS modalities. Peripheral nerve stimulation technologies have also undergone rapid development and become less invasive, including many that are placed percutaneously. There is low-to-moderate quality evidence that peripheral nerve stimulation is effective for neuropathic pain in an extremity, low quality evidence that it is effective for back pain with or without leg pain, and conflicting evidence that it can prevent migraines. In the USA and many areas in Europe, deep brain and motor cortex stimulation are not approved for chronic pain, but are used off-label for refractory cases. Overall, there is mixed evidence supporting brain stimulation, with most sham-controlled trials yielding negative findings. Regarding non-invasive modalities, there is moderate quality evidence that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation does not provide meaningful benefit for chronic pain in general, but conflicting evidence regarding pain relief for neuropathic pain and headaches. For transcranial direct current stimulation, there is low-quality evidence supporting its benefit for chronic pain, but conflicting evidence regarding a small treatment effect for neuropathic pain and headaches. For transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, there is low-quality evidence that it is superior to sham or no treatment for neuropathic pain, but conflicting evidence for non-neuropathic pain. Future research should focus on better evaluating the short-term and long-term effectiveness of all neuromodulation modalities and whether they decrease health-care use, and on refining selection criteria and treatment variables.","[Knotkova, Helena] MJHS Inst Innovat Palliat Care, New York, NY USA; [Knotkova, Helena] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Family & Social Med, Bronx, NY 10467 USA; [Hamani, Clement] Univ Toronto, Harquail Ctr Neuromodulat, Sunnybrook Res Inst, Div Neurosurg,Sunnybrook Hlth Sci Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Sivanesan, Eellan] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol & Crit Care Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Cohen, Steven P.] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Baltimore, MD USA; [Cohen, Steven P.] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Baltimore, MD USA; [Cohen, Steven P.] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Baltimore, MD USA; [Elgueta Le Beuffe, Maria Francisca] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Anesthesiol, Santiago, Chile; [Moon, Jee Youn] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Anesthesiol, Seoul, South Korea; [Cohen, Steven P.] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Anesthesiol, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Cohen, Steven P.] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Huntoon, Marc A.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Anesthesiol, Richmond, VA USA",,"Cohen, SP (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol & Crit Care Med, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",scohen40@jhmi.edu,"Sivanesan, Eellan/I-6399-2019","Sivanesan, Eellan/0000-0003-3419-9209","Musculoskeletal Injury Rehabilitation Research for Operational Readiness; Department of Physical Medicine AMP; Rehabilitation, Uniformed Services University; US Department of Defense [HU00011920011]","Musculoskeletal Injury Rehabilitation Research for Operational Readiness; Department of Physical Medicine AMP; Rehabilitation, Uniformed Services University; US Department of Defense(United States Department of Defense)","This work was partly supported (partial effort for SPC paid to Johns Hopkins) by the Musculoskeletal Injury Rehabilitation Research for Operational Readiness, Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, Uniformed Services University, US Department of Defense (HU00011920011).

We undertook a meta-analysis of data from all large statin trials to compare the effects of statin therapy at different ages. Methods In this meta-analysis, randomised trials of statin therapy were eligible if they aimed to recruit at least 1000 participants with a scheduled treatment duration of at least 2 years. We analysed individual participant data from 22 trials (n=134 537) and detailed summary data from one trial (n=12 705) of statin therapy versus control, plus individual participant data from five trials of more intensive versus less intensive statin therapy (n=39 612). We subdivided participants into six age groups (55 years or younger, 56-60 years, 61-65 years, 66-70 years, 71-75 years, and older than 75 years). We estimated effects on major vascular events (ie, major coronary events, strokes, and coronary revascularisations), cause-specific mortality, and cancer incidence as the rate ratio (RR) per 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol. We compared proportional risk reductions in different age subgroups by use of standard 2 tests for heterogeneity when there were two groups, or trend when there were more than two groups. Findings 14 483 (8%) of 186 854 participants in the 28 trials were older than 75 years at randomisation, and the median follow-up duration was 4.9 years. Overall, statin therapy or a more intensive statin regimen produced a 21% (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.77-0.81) proportional reduction in major vascular events per 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol. We observed a significant reduction in major vascular events in all age groups. Although proportional reductions in major vascular events diminished slightly with age, this trend was not statistically significant (p(trend)=0.06). Overall, statin or more intensive therapy yielded a 24% (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.73-0.79) proportional reduction in major coronary events per 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, and with increasing age, we observed a trend towards smaller proportional risk reductions in major coronary events (p(trend)=0.009). We observed a 25% (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.73-0.78) proportional reduction in the risk of coronary revascularisation procedures with statin therapy or a more intensive statin regimen per 1.0 mmol/L lower LDL cholesterol, which did not differ significantly across age groups (p(trend)=0.6). Similarly, the proportional reductions in stroke of any type (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.80-0.89) did not differ significantly across age groups (p(trend)=0.7). After exclusion of four trials which enrolled only patients with heart failure or undergoing renal dialysis (among whom statin therapy has not been shown to be effective), the trend to smaller proportional risk reductions with increasing age persisted for major coronary events (p(trend)=0.01), and remained non-significant for major vascular events (p(trend)=0.3). The proportional reduction in major vascular events was similar, irrespective of age, among patients with pre-existing vascular disease (p(trend)=0.2), but appeared smaller among older than among younger individuals not known to have vascular disease (p(trend)=0.05). We found a 12% (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.85-0.91) proportional reduction in vascular mortality per 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, with a trend towards smaller proportional reductions with older age (p(trend)=0.004), but this trend did not persist after exclusion of the heart failure or dialysis trials (p(trend)=0.2). Statin therapy had no effect at any age on non-vascular mortality, cancer death, or cancer incidence. Interpretation Statin therapy produces significant reductions in major vascular events irrespective of age, but there is less direct evidence of benefit among patients older than 75 years who do not already have evidence of occlusive vascular disease. This limitation is now being addressed by further trials. Copyright (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

OBJECTIVE To review the evidence on screening for eating disorders in adolescents and adults to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and trial registries through December 19, 2020; surveillance through January 1, 2022. STUDY SELECTION English-language studies of screening test accuracy, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of screening or interventions for eating disorders in populations with screen-detected or previously untreated eating disorders (trials limited to populations who are underweight were ineligible). DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality. Meta-analysis of test accuracy studies and intervention trials. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Test accuracy, eating disorder symptom severity, quality of life, depression, and harms. RESULTS Fifty-seven studies were included (N = 10 773); 3 (n = 1073) limited to adolescents (mean or median age, 14-15 years). No study directly evaluated the benefits and harms of screening. Seventeen studies (n = 6804) evaluated screening test accuracy. The SCOFF questionnaire (cut point >= 2) had a pooled sensitivity of 84%(95% CI, 74% to 90%) and pooled specificity of 80% (95% CI, 65% to 89%) in adults (10 studies, n = 3684). Forty RCTs (n = 3969) evaluated interventions for eating disorders; none enrolled a screen-detected population. Lisdexamfetamine for binge eating disorder (4 RCTs; n = 900) was associated with larger reductions in eating disorder symptom severity on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for binge eating (YBOCS-BE) than placebo (pooled mean difference, -5.75 [95% CI, -8.32 to -3.17]). Two RCTs (n = 465) of topiramate for binge eating disorder found larger reductions in YBOCS-BE scores associated with topiramate than placebo, from -6.40 (95% CI, -8.16 to -4.64) to -2.55 (95% CI, -4.22 to -0.88). Nine pharmacotherapy trials (n = 2006) reported on harms. Compared with placebo, lisdexamfetamine was associated with higher rates of dry mouth, headache, and insomnia, and topiramate was associated with higher rates of paresthesia, taste perversion, confusion, and concentration difficulty. Twenty-four trials (n = 1644) assessed psychological interventions. Guided self-help for binge eating disorder improved eating disorder symptom severity more than control (pooled standardized mean difference, -0.96 [95% CI, -1.26 to -0.67]) (5 studies, n = 391). Evidence on other interventions was limited. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE No studies directly assessed the benefits and harms of screening. The SCOFF questionnaire had adequate accuracy for detecting eating disorders among adults. No treatment trials enrolled screen-detected populations; guided self-help, lisdexamfetamine, and topiramate were effective for reducing eating disorder symptom severity among referred populations with binge eating disorder, but pharmacotherapies were also associated with harms.","[Feltner, Cynthia; Reddy, Shivani; Riley, Sean; Berkman, Nancy; Middleton, Jennifer Cook; Balio, Casey; Coker-Schwimmer, Manny; Jonas, Daniel E.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, RTI Int, Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Feltner, Cynthia] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Med, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Feltner, Cynthia; Middleton, Jennifer Cook] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Cecil G Sheps Ctr Hlth Serv Res, 725 Martin Luther King Jr Blvd,CB 7295, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Peat, Christine] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Psychiat, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Riley, Sean; Coker-Schwimmer, Manny; Jonas, Daniel E.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Internal Med, Coll Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Balio, Casey] East Tennessee State Univ, Ctr Rural Hlth Res, Johnson City, TN USA",,"Feltner, C (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Cecil G Sheps Ctr Hlth Serv Res, 725 Martin Luther King Jr Blvd,CB 7295, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",cindy_feltner@med.unc.edu,,"Reddy, Shivani/0000-0003-2803-6155; Berkman, Nancy/0000-0003-3617-1082","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA-290-2015-00011-I]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA-290-2015-00011-I, Task Order 15, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).",,75,4,4,2,2,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Several features of clinical management for community-acquired pneumonia should be addressed to reduce mortality, morbidity, and complications related to community-acquired pneumonia in patients who are immunocompetent and patients who are immunocompromised. These features include rapid diagnosis, microbiological investigation, prevention and management of complications (eg, respiratory failure, sepsis, and multiorgan failure), empirical antibiotic therapy in accordance with patient's risk factors and local microbiological epidemiology, individualised antibiotic therapy according to microbiological data, appropriate outcomes for therapeutic switch from parenteral to oral antibiotics, discharge planning, and long-term follow-up.

Objective To update its 2014 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a review of the evidence on screening for cognitive impairment, including mild cognitive impairment and mild to moderate dementia, in community-dwelling adults, including those 65 years or older residing in independent living facilities. Population This recommendation applies to community-dwelling older adults 65 years or older, without recognized signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment. Evidence Assessment The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is lacking, and the balance of benefits and harms of screening for cognitive impairment cannot be determined. Recommendation The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for cognitive impairment in older adults.

Several clinical forms of alpha-thalassaemia and beta-thalassaemia, including the co-inheritance of beta-thalassaemia with haemoglobin E resulting in haemoglobin E/beta-thalassaemia, have been described. The disease hallmarks include imbalance in the alpha/beta-globin chain ratio, ineffective erythropoiesis, chronic haemolytic anaemia, compensatory haemopoietic expansion, hypercoagulability, and increased intestinal iron absorption. The complications of iron overload, arising from transfusions that represent the basis of disease management in most patients with severe thalassaemia, might further complicate the clinical phenotype. These pathophysiological mechanisms lead to an array of clinical manifestations involving numerous organ systems. Conventional management primarily relies on transfusion and iron-chelation therapy, as well as splenectomy in specific cases. An increased understanding of the molecular and pathogenic factors that govern the disease process have suggested routes for the development of new therapeutic approaches that address the underlying chain imbalance, ineffective erythropoiesis, and iron dysregulation, with several agents being evaluated in preclinical models and clinical trials.","[Taher, Ali T.] Amer Univ Beirut, Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, POB 11-0236, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon; [Weatherall, David J.] Univ Oxford, MRC Weatherall Inst Mol Med, Oxford, England; [Cappellini, Maria Domenica] Univ Milan, IRCCS Ca Granda Fdn Maggiore Policlin Hosp, Dept Clin Sci & Commun, Milan, Italy",,"Taher, AT (corresponding author), Amer Univ Beirut, Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, POB 11-0236, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon.",ataher@aub.edu.lb,"CAPPELLINI, MARIA DOMENICA/B-4475-2017","CAPPELLINI, MARIA DOMENICA/0000-0001-8676-6864","MRC [MC_UU_12009/13, MC_UU_00016/12] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [MC_UU_12009/13, MC_UU_00016/12] Funding Source: Medline",MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission),,,139,302,331,31,153,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,JAN 13,2018,391,10116,,,,,155,167,,10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31822-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31822-6,,,13,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,FT0EG,28774421,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000422793400030,View Full Record in Web of Science,72916,0,104,29,39,46,104,48,30,95,106,5,58,45,107,42,125

By contrast, double-duty actions, which aim to simultaneously tackle both undernutrition and problems of overweight, obesity, and diet-related non-communicable diseases (DR-NCDs) have been proposed as a way to effectively address malnutrition in all its forms in a more holisitic way. This Series paper identifies ten double-duty actions that have strong potential to reduce the risk of both undernutrition, obesity, and DR-NCDs. It does so by summarising evidence on common drivers of different forms of malnutrition; documenting examples of unintended harm caused by some undemutrition-focused programmes on obesity and DR-NCDs; and highlighting examples of double-duty actions to tackle multiple forms of malnutrition. We find that undernutrition, obesity, and DR-NCDs are intrinsically linked through early-life nutrition, diet diversity, food environments, and socioeconomic factors. Some evidence shows that programmes focused on undernutrition have raised risks of poor quality diets, obesity, and DR-NCDs, especially in countries undergoing a rapid nutrition transition. This Series paper builds on this evidence to develop a framework to guide the design of double-duty approaches and strategies, and defines the first steps needed to deliver them. With a clear package of double-duty actions now identified, there is an urgent need to move forward with double-duty actions to address malnutrition in all its forms.","[Hawkes, Corinna] City Univ London, Ctr Food Policy, London EC1R 1UW, England; [Ruel, Marie T.; Salm, Leah] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Sinclair, Bryony] World Canc Res Fund Int, London, England; [Branca, Francesco] World Hlth Org, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Hawkes, C (corresponding author), City Univ London, Ctr Food Policy, London EC1R 1UW, England.",corinna.hawkes@city.ac.uk,,"Ruel, Marie/0000-0002-9506-348X",WHO through Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH) by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),WHO through Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(CGIAR); CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH) by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)(CGIAR),"Funding for the preparation of the Series was provided by WHO, through a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

The cause remains unknown but the pathogenesis of idiopathic NS is thought to involve immune dysregulation, systemic circulating factors, or inherited structural abnormalities of the podocyte. Genetic risk is more commonly described among children with steroid-resistant disease. The mainstay of therapy is prednisone for the vast majority of patients who are steroid responsive; however, the disease can run a frequently relapsing course, necessitating the need for alternative immunosuppressive agents. Infection and venous thromboembolism are the main complications of NS with also increased risk of acute kidney injury. Prognosis in terms of long-term kidney outcome overall is excellent for steroid-responsive disease, and steroid resistance is an important determinant of future risk of chronic or end-stage kidney disease.","[Noone, Damien G.; Parekh, Rulan] Univ Toronto, Dept Paediat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Noone, Damien G.; Parekh, Rulan] Hosp Sick Children, Div Nephrol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Iijima, Kazumoto] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Parekh, Rulan] Hosp Sick Children, Res Inst, Child Hlth Evaluat Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Parekh, Rulan] Univ Hlth Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Parekh, Rulan] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth & Hlth Policy Management, Toronto, ON, Canada",,"Parekh, R (corresponding author), Hosp Sick Children, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada.",rulan.parekh@sickkids.ca,"Parekh, Rulan/AAQ-4411-2020","Parekh, Rulan/0000-0001-6313-5752",Novartis Pharma; Japan Blood Product Organization; AbbVie; JCR Pharmaceuticals; Daiichi Sankyo; Teijin Pharma; CSL Behring; Novo Nordisk Pharma; Air Water Medical; Astellas Pharma; Takeda Pharmaceutical; Taisho Toyama Pharmaceutical; Eisai; Biofermin Pharmaceutical; Zenyaku Kogyo; Chugai Pharmaceutical; Springer Japan; Meiji Seika Pharma; Asahi kasei Pharma Corporation; Medical Review; Nippon Boehringer Ingelheim; Baxter Limited; Ono Pharmaceutical; Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyusho; Sanofi; Alexion Pharma; Kyowa Hakko Kirin,Novartis Pharma; Japan Blood Product Organization; AbbVie(AbbVie); JCR Pharmaceuticals; Daiichi Sankyo(Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited); Teijin Pharma; CSL Behring; Novo Nordisk Pharma(Novo Nordisk); Air Water Medical; Astellas Pharma(Astellas Pharmaceuticals); Takeda Pharmaceutical(Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd); Taisho Toyama Pharmaceutical; Eisai(Eisai Co Ltd); Biofermin Pharmaceutical(Johnson & Johnson); Zenyaku Kogyo; Chugai Pharmaceutical; Springer Japan; Meiji Seika Pharma; Asahi kasei Pharma Corporation; Medical Review; Nippon Boehringer Ingelheim(Boehringer Ingelheim); Baxter Limited; Ono Pharmaceutical; Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyusho; Sanofi; Alexion Pharma; Kyowa Hakko Kirin(Kyowa Kirin Ltd),"DGN declares no competing interests.

Opioid tolerance (increased dose needed for analgesia) and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (paradoxical increase in pain with opioid administration) can contribute to both poorly controlled pain and dose escalation. Hyperalgesia is particularly problematic as further opioid prescribing is largely futile. The mechanisms of opioid tolerance and hyperalgesia are complex, involving mu opioid receptor signalling pathways that offer opportunities for novel analgesic alternatives. The intracellular scaffold protein beta-arrestin-2 is implicated in tolerance, hyperalgesia, and other opioid side-effects. Development of agonists biased against recruitment of beta-arrestin-2 could provide analgesic efficacy with fewer side-effects. Alternative approaches include inhibition of peripheral mu opioid receptors and blockade of downstream signalling mechanisms, such as the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src or N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Furthermore, it is prudent to use multimodal analgesic regimens to reduce reliance on opioids during the perioperative period. In the third paper in this Series we focus on clinical and mechanism-based understanding of tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia, and discuss current and future strategies for pain management.","[Colvin, Lesley A.] Univ Dundee, Div Populat Hlth & Genom, Ninewells Hosp & Med Sch, Dundee DD2 4RB, Scotland; [Bull, Fiona; Hales, Tim G.] Univ Dundee, Inst Acad Anaesthesia, Div Syst Med, Sch Med,Ninewells Hosp, Dundee, Scotland",,"Colvin, LA (corresponding author), Univ Dundee, Div Populat Hlth & Genom, Ninewells Hosp & Med Sch, Dundee DD2 4RB, Scotland.",l.a.colvin@dundee.ac.uk,,"Bull, Fiona/0000-0002-7016-0611; Colvin, Lesley/0000-0002-1563-8600",,,,,121,140,146,10,64,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,APR 13,2019,393,10180,,,,,1558,1568,,10.1016/S0140-6736(19)30430-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(19)30430-1,,,11,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,HU0DA,30983591,Green Published,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000464940400032,View Full Record in Web of Science,73827,0,9,115,26,103,80,118,62,56,91,97,96,76,50,80,103

Gastric cancer is diagnosed histologically after endoscopic biopsy and staged using CT, endoscopic ultrasound, PET, and laparoscopy. It is a molecularly and phenotypically highly heterogeneous disease. The main treatment for early gastric cancer is endoscopic resection. Non-early operable gastric cancer is treated with surgery, which should include D2 lymphadenectomy (including lymph node stations in the perigastric mesentery and along the celiac arterial branches). Perioperative or adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival in patients with stage 1B or higher cancers. Advanced gastric cancer is treated with sequential lines of chemotherapy, starting with a platinum and fluoropyrimidine doublet in the first line; median survival is less than 1 year.

Nevertheless, leaders and practitioners in academic science and medicine continue to be unaware of and poorly educated about the nature, extent, and impact of barriers to full participation of women and minorities in science and medicine around the world. This lack of awareness and education results in failures to fully mobilise the human capital of half the population and limits global technological and medical advancements. The chronic lack of recruitment, promotion, and retention of women in science and medicine is due to systemic, structural, organisational, institutional, cultural, and societal barriers to equity and inclusion. These barriers must be identified and removed through increased awareness of the challenges combined with evidence-based, data-driven approaches leading to measurable targets and outcomes. In this Review, we discuss these issues and highlight actions that could achieve gender equality in science and medicine. We survey approaches and insights that have helped to identify and remove systemic bias and barriers in science and medicine, and propose tools that will help organisational change toward gender equality. We describe tools that include formal legislation and mandated quotas at national or large-scale levels (eg, gender parity), techniques that increase fairness (eg, gender equity) through facilitated organisational cultural change at institutional levels, and professional development of core competencies at individual levels. This Review is not intended to be an extensive analysis of all the literature currently available on achieving gender equality in academic medicine and science, but rather, a reflection on finding multifactorial solutions.","[Coe, Imogen R.] Ryerson Univ, Dept Biol & Chem, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada; [Wiley, Ryan] McNaster Univ, Dept Pathol & Mol Med, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Wiley, Ryan] Shift Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Bekker, Linda-Gail] Univ Cape Town, Desmond Tutu HIV Ctr, Inst Infect Dis & Mol Med, Fac Hlth Sci, Cape Town, South Africa",,"Coe, IR (corresponding author), Ryerson Univ, Dept Biol & Chem, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada.",imogen.coe@ryerson.ca,"Wiley, Ryan/AAU-1123-2020; Bekker, Linda-Gail/AAZ-8929-2020","BEKKER, LINDA-GAIL/0000-0002-0755-4386",,,,,51,62,62,3,26,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,FEB 9,2019,393,10171,,,,,587,593,,10.1016/S0140-6736(18)33188-X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)33188-X,,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),General & Internal Medicine,HK7QO,30739694,Bronze,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000458184300040,View Full Record in Web of Science,73945,0,37,26,23,13,7,29,1,34,7,35,9,44,19,32,4

Most of these people will be labelled as having a functional gastrointestinal disorder, such as irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, or functional constipation. These conditions affect up to 40% of people at any one point in time, and two-thirds of these people will have chronic, fluctuating symptoms. The pathophysiology of functional gastrointestinal disorders is complex, but involves bidirectional dysregulation of gut-brain interaction (via the gut-brain axis), as well as microbial dysbiosis within the gut, altered mucosal immune function, visceral hypersensitivity, and abnormal gastrointestinal motility. Hence, nomenclature refers to the conditions as disorders of gut-brain interaction. Psychological comorbidity is common; however, whether or not this predates, or is driven by, symptoms is not clear. Patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders can feel stigmatised, and often this diagnosis is not communicated effectively by physicians, nor is education provided. Prompt identification and treatment of these conditions is crucial as they have a considerable impact on health-care systems and society as a whole because of repeated consultations, unnecessary investigations and surgeries, prescriptions and over-the-counter medicine use, and impaired health-related quality of life and ability to work. Symptom-based criteria are used to make a diagnosis, with judicious use of limited investigations in some patients. The general principles of treatment are based on a biopsychosocial understanding and involve management of physical symptoms and, if present, psychological comorbidity. In the future, treatment approaches to functional gastrointestinal disorders are likely to become more personalised, based not only on symptoms but also underlying pathophysiology and psychology.","[Black, Christopher J.; Ford, Alexander C.] St James Univ Hosp, Leeds Gastroenterol Inst, Leeds LS9 7TF, W Yorkshire, England; [Black, Christopher J.; Ford, Alexander C.] Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Med Res St Jamess, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Drossman, Douglas A.] Univ N Carolina, Ctr Educ & Practice Biopsychosocial Care, Drossman Gastroenterol, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Drossman, Douglas A.; Ruddy, Johannah] Rome Fdn, Raleigh, NC USA; [Talley, Nicholas J.] Univ Newcastle, NHMRC Ctr Res Excellence Digest Hlth, Newcastle, NSW, Australia; [Talley, Nicholas J.] Hunter Med Res Inst, Lambton, NSW, Australia; [Ruddy, Johannah] DrossmanCare, Ctr Educ & Practice Biopsychosocial Care, Durham, NC USA",,"Ford, AC (corresponding author), St James Univ Hosp, Leeds Gastroenterol Inst, Leeds LS9 7TF, W Yorkshire, England.",alexf12399@yahoo.com,"Ford, Alexander C/K-5491-2012","Ford, Alexander C/0000-0001-6371-4359; Ruddy, Johannah/0000-0003-4989-6066; Casas Gallegos, Isabel/0000-0002-2805-4604",,,,,99,64,65,13,26,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,NOV 21,2020,396,10263,,,,,1664,1674,,10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32115-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32115-2,,,11,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,OU3IH,33049221,Green Accepted,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000591424900030,View Full Record in Web of Science,74141,0,53,46,85,91,86,12,45,71,4,73,63,8,25,87,96

Stridor, suprasternal retractions, and change of voice are the sentinel signs of upper airway obstruction. Most of the common causes among children presenting to emergency department are of acute infectious etiology. Among these, croup is the commonest while diphteria remains the most serious life-threatening cause. Recent reports indicate that bacterial tracheitis has become increasingly common. In ER evaluation the key clinical data in determining the cause and the site of obstruction are the onset, presence of fever, character of the stridor, retractions, the voice and the ability to handle secretions. After assessment of the severity of respiratory distress and resuscitative or supportive therapy including oxygen and emergent airway, specific treatment is directed at underlying etiology. All patients with audible stridor require early endotracheal intubation/tracheostomy. In croup the mainstay of treatment are cold humidified oxygen, budesonide nebulization ( in mild cases), Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg iv or im (in moderate and severe cases), and Adrenaline 5 ml 1:1000 (5 mg) solution as nebulization ( in severe cases). In diphtheria, early tracheostomy, anti-diphtheric serum and injectable penicillin are critical. Bacterial Tracheitis and Retropharyngeal abscess need early administration of injectable Cloxacillin, Amikacin and Clindamycin. ENT consultation should be obtained for early surgical drainage of retropharyngeal abscess. Angioneurotic edema is treated with subcutaneous adrenaline (1:1000, 0.01 ml/kg); hydrocortisone 10 mg/kg IV and antihistamines. Patients with severe obstruction and those with endotracheal tube/ trachesotomy should be transferred to PICU.","[Eskander, Antoine; de Almeida, John R.; Irish, Jonathan C.] Univ Toronto, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg Surg Oncol, Sunnybrook Hlth Sci Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Eskander, Antoine; de Almeida, John R.] Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Sunnybrook Hlth Sci Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Eskander, Antoine] Michael Garron Hosp, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Eskander, Antoine] Inst Clin Evaluat Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [de Almeida, John R.; Irish, Jonathan C.] Princess Margaret Canc Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada",,"Irish, JC (corresponding author), Univ Hlth Network, Princess Margaret Canc Ctr, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, 200 Elizabeth St,8NU-882, Toronto, ON M5G 2C4, Canada.",jonathan.irish@uhn.ca,,,,,,,64,12,12,1,12,MASSACHUSETTS MEDICAL SOC,WALTHAM,"WALTHAM WOODS CENTER, 860 WINTER ST,, WALTHAM, MA 02451-1413 USA",0028-4793,1533-4406,,NEW ENGL J MED,N.

Although the diagnosis of hypertension is still based on office blood pressure, confirmation with out-of-office blood pressure measurements (ie, ambulatory or home monitoring) is strongly recommended. The definition of hypertension differs throughout various guidelines, but the indications for antihypertensive therapy are relatively similar. Lifestyle adaptation is absolutely key in non-pharmacological treatment. Pharmacologically, angiotens-inconverting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics are the first-line agents, with advice for the use of single-pill combination therapy by most guidelines. As a fourth-line agent, spironolactone should be considered. The rapidly evolving field of device-based therapy, especially renal denervation, will further broaden therapeutic options. Despite being a largely controllable condition, the actual rates of awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension are disappointingly low.

A variable degree of organ involvement is present that contributes to the severity of the medical picture. Heatstroke can be viewed as a tropical neurological disorder especially for unacclimated travelers going to warm climates. Heatstroke can be categorized into two types depending on the cause. Classic heatstroke is nonexertional, environmentally related and exertional heatstroke occurs in the setting of strenuous exercise.

Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial and is supported by diagnostic criteria, incorporating imaging and spinal fluid abnormalities for those presenting with a clinically isolated syndrome. Importantly, there is an extensive therapeutic armamentarium, both oral and by infusion, for those with the relapsing remitting form of the disease. Careful consideration is required when choosing the correct treatment, balancing the side-effect profile with efficacy and escalating as clinically appropriate. This move towards more personalised medicine is supported by a clinical guideline published in 2018. Finally, a comprehensive management programme is strongly recommended for all patients with multiple sclerosis, enhancing health-related quality of life through advocating wellness, addressing aggravating factors, and managing comorbidities. The greatest remaining challenge for multiple sclerosis is the development of treatments incorporating neuroprotection and remyelination to treat and ultimately prevent the disabling, progressive forms of the condition.","[Thompson, Alan J.; Ciccarelli, Olga] UCL Inst Neurol, Queen Sq MS Ctr, London WC1N 3BG, England; [Thompson, Alan J.; Ciccarelli, Olga] NIHR Univ Coll London Hosp Biomed Res Ctr, London, England; [Baranzini, Sergio E.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol, San Francisco, CA USA; [Geurts, Jeroen] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Med Ctr, Dept Anat & Neurosci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Hemmer, Bernhard] Tech Univ Munich, Klinikum Rechts Isar, Dept Neurol, Munich, Germany; [Hemmer, Bernhard] Munich Cluster Syst Neurol SyNergy, Munich, Germany",,"Thompson, AJ (corresponding author), UCL Inst Neurol, Queen Sq MS Ctr, London WC1N 3BG, England.",alan.thompson@ucl.ac.uk,"Hemmer, Bernhard/AAT-8388-2021; Thompson, Alan J/C-2654-2008; Ciccarelli, Olga/AAY-3328-2020","Hemmer, Bernhard/0000-0001-5985-6784; Thompson, Alan J/0000-0002-4333-8496; Ciccarelli, Olga/0000-0001-7485-1367; Baranzini, Sergio/0000-0003-0067-194X",UK National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre,UK National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre,"AJT and OC acknowledge the support of the UK National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre.

IMPORTANCE Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are characterized by a sudden reduction in blood supply to the heart and include ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-STEMI (NSTEMI), and unstable angina. Each year, an estimated more than 7 million people in the world are diagnosed with ACS, including more than 1 million patients hospitalized in the US. OBSERVATIONS Chest discomfort at rest is the most common presenting symptom of ACS and affects approximately 79% of men and 74% of women presenting with ACS, although approximately 40% of men and 48% of women present with nonspecific symptoms, such as dyspnea, either in isolation or, more commonly, in combination with chest pain. For patients presenting with possible ACS, electrocardiography should be performed immediately (within 10 minutes of presentation) and can distinguish between STEMI and non-ST-segment elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS). STEMI is caused by complete coronary artery occlusion and accounts for approximately 30% of ACS. ACS without significant ST-segment elevation on electrocardiography, termed NSTE-ACS, account for approximately 70% of ACS, are caused by partial or intermittent occlusion of the artery and are associated with ST-segment depressions (approximately 31%), T-wave inversions (approximately 12%), ST-segment depressions combined with T-wave inversions (16%), or neither (approximately 41%). When electrocardiography suggests STEMI, rapid reperfusion with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within 120 minutes reduces mortality from 9% to 7%. If PCI within 120 minutes is not possible, fibrinolytic therapy with alteplase, reteplase, or tenecteplase at full dose should be administered for patients younger than 75 years without contraindications and at half dose for patients 75 years or older (or streptokinase at full dose if cost is a consideration), followed by transfer to a facility with the goal of PCI within the next 24 hours. High-sensitivity troponin measurements are the preferred test to evaluate for NSTEMI. In high-risk patients with NSTE-ACS and no contraindications, prompt invasive coronary angiography and percutaneous or surgical revascularization within 24 to 48 hours are associated with a reduction in death from 6.5% to 4.9%. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Each year, an estimated more than 7 million people are diagnosed with ACS worldwide. For patients with STEMI, coronary catheterization and PCI within 2 hours of presentation reduces mortality, with fibrinolytic therapy reserved for patients without access to immediate PCI. For high-risk patients with NSTE-ACS without contraindications, prompt invasive coronary angiography followed by percutaneous or surgical revascularization is associated with lower rates of death.","[Bhatt, Deepak L.] Harvard Med Sch, Heart & Vasc Inst, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lopes, Renato D.] Duke Univ, Duke Clin Res Inst, Div Cardiol, Sch Med, Durham, NC USA; [Harrington, Robert A.] Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,"Bhatt, DL (corresponding author), 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",dlbhattmd@post.harvard.edu,,,,,,,109,4,4,9,9,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

A major challenge for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is to achieve an appropriate balance between rigorous testing and the need for timely approval of drugs that have benefits that outweigh their risks. OBJECTIVE To describe the evolution of laws and standards affecting drug testing, the use of new approval programs and standards, expansions of the role and authority of the FDA, and changes in the number of drugs approved from the 1980s to 2018. EVIDENCE Sources of evidence included principal federal laws and FDA regulations (1962-2018) and FDA databases of approved new drugs (1984-2018), generic drugs (1970-2018), biologics (1984-2018), and vaccines (1998-2018); special development and approval programs (Orphan drug [1984-2018], Fast-Track [1988-2018], Priority Review and its predecessors [1984-2018], Accelerated Approval [1992-2018], and Breakthrough Therapy [2012-2018]); expanded access (2010-2017) and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (2008-2018); and user fees paid to the FDA by industry (1993-2018). FINDINGS From 1983 to 2018, legislation and regulatory initiatives have substantially changed drug approval at the FDA. The mean annual number of new drug approvals, including biologics, was 34 from 1990-1999, 25 from 2000-2009, and 41 from 2010-2018. New biologic product approvals increased from a median of 2.5 from 1990-1999, to 5 from 2000-2013, to 12 from 2014-2018. The median annual number of generic drugs approved was 136 from 1970 to the enactment of the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984; 284 from 1985 to the enactment of the Generic Drug User Fee Act in 2012; and 588 from 2013-2018. Prescription drug user fee funding expanded from new drugs and biologics in 1992 to generic and biosimilar drugs in 2012. The amount of Prescription Drug User Fee Act fees collected from industry increased from an annual mean of $66 million in 1993-1997 to $820 million in 2013-2017, and in 2018, user fees accounted for approximately 80% of the salaries of review personnel responsible for the approval of new drugs. The proportion of drugs approved with an Orphan Drug Act designation increased from 18% (55/304) in 1984-1995, to 22% (82/379) in 1996-2007, to 41% (154/380) in 2008-2018. Use of Accelerated Approval, Fast-Track, and Priority Review for new drugs has increased over time, with 81% (48/59) of new drugs benefiting from at least 1 such expedited program in 2018. The proportion of new approvals supported by at least 2 pivotal trials decreased from 80.6% in 1995-1997 to 52.8% in 2015-2017, based on 124 and 106 approvals, respectively, while the median number of patients studied did not change significantly (774 vs 816). FDA drug review times declined from more than 3 years in 1983 to less than 1 year in 2017, but total time from the authorization of clinical testing to approval has remained at approximately 8 years over that period. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Over the last 4 decades, the approval and regulation processes for pharmaceutical agents have evolved and increased in complexity as special programs have been added and as the use of surrogate measures has been encouraged. The FDA funding needed to implement and manage these programs has been addressed by expanding industry-paid user fees. The FDA has increasingly accepted less data and more surrogate measures, and has shortened its review times.","[Darrow, Jonathan J.; Avorn, Jerry; Kesselheim, Aaron S.] Harvard Med Sch, Div Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmacoecon, Program Regulat Therapeut & Law PORTAL, Dept Med,Brigham & Womens Hosp, 1620 Tremont St,Ste 3030, Boston, MA 02120 USA",,"Darrow, JJ (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Div Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmacoecon, Program Regulat Therapeut & Law PORTAL, Dept Med,Brigham & Womens Hosp, 1620 Tremont St,Ste 3030, Boston, MA 02120 USA.",jjdarrow@bwh.harvard.edu,,,Arnold Ventures; Harvard-MIT Center for Regulatory Science; Engelberg Foundation,Arnold Ventures; Harvard-MIT Center for Regulatory Science; Engelberg Foundation,This work was supported by Arnold Ventures and by grant support from the Harvard-MIT Center for Regulatory Science and the Engelberg Foundation.,,90,93,97,13,43,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

We aimed to prospectively plan a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing these radiotherapy approaches. Methods We used a prospective framework for adaptive meta-analysis (FAME), starting the review process while eligible trials were ongoing. RCTs were eligible if they aimed to compare immediate adjuvant radiotherapy versus early salvage radiotherapy, following radical prostatectomy in men (age >= 18 years) with intermediate-risk or high-risk, localised or locally advanced prostate cancer. We searched trial registers and conference proceedings until July 8, 2020, to identify eligible RCTs. By establishing the ARTISTIC collaboration with relevant trialists, we were able to anticipate when eligible trial results would emerge, and we developed and registered a protocol with PROSPERO before knowledge of the trial results (CRD42019132669). We used a harmonised definition of event-free survival, as the time from randomisation until the first evidence of either biochemical progression (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] >= 0.4 ng/mL and rising after completion of any postoperative radiotherapy), clinical or radiological progression, initiation of a non-trial treatment, death from prostate cancer, or a PSA level of at least 2.0 ng/mL at any time after randomisation. We predicted when we would have sufficient power to assess whether adjuvant radiotherapy was superior to early salvage radiotherapy. Investigators supplied results for event-free survival, both overall and within predefined patient subgroups. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the effects of radiotherapy timing on event-free survival and subgroup interactions were combined using fixed-effect meta-analysis. Findings We identified three eligible trials and were able to obtain updated results for event-free survival for 2153 patients recruited between November, 2007, and December, 2016. Median follow-up ranged from 60 months to 78 months, with a maximum follow-up of 132 months. 1075 patients were randomly assigned to receive adjuvant radiotherapy and 1078 to a policy of early salvage radiotherapy, of whom 421 (39.1%) had commenced treatment at the time of analysis. Patient characteristics were balanced within trials and overall. Median age was similar between trials at 64 or 65 years (with IQRs ranging from 59 to 68 years) across the three trials and most patients (1671 [77.6%]) had a Gleason score of 7. All trials were assessed as having low risk of bias. Based on 270 events, the meta-analysis showed no evidence that event-free survival was improved with adjuvant radiotherapy compared with early salvage radiotherapy (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.75-1.21; p=0.70), with only a 1 percentage point (95% CI -2 to 3) change in 5-year event-free survival (89% vs 88%). Results were consistent across trials (heterogeneity p=0.18; I-2=42%). Interpretation This collaborative and prospectively designed systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that adjuvant radiotherapy does not improve event-free survival in men with localised or locally advanced prostate cancer. Until data on long-term outcomes are available, early salvage treatment would seem the preferable treatment policy as it offers the opportunity to spare many men radiotherapy and its associated side-effects.

Observations Thirty-day mortality for patients with cardiogenic shock due to myocardial infarction is approximately 40%, and 1-year mortality approaches 50%. Immediate revascularization of the infarct-related coronary artery remains the only treatment for cardiogenic shock associated with acute myocardial infarction supported by randomized clinical trials. The Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Strategies with Acute Myocardial Infarction and Cardiogenic Shock (CULPRIT-SHOCK) clinical trial demonstrated a reduction in the primary outcome of 30-day death or kidney replacement therapy; 158 of 344 patients (45.9%) in the culprit lesion revascularization-only group compared with 189 of 341 patients (55.4%) in the multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention group (relative risk, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.71-0.96]; P = .01). Despite a lack of randomized trials demonstrating benefit, percutaneous mechanical circulatory support devices are frequently used to manage cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction. Conclusions and Relevance Cardiogenic shock occurs in up to 10% of patients immediately following acute myocardial infarction and is associated with mortality rates of nearly 40% at 30 days and 50% at 1 year. Current evidence and clinical practice guidelines support immediate revascularization of the infarct-related coronary artery as the primary therapy for cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction. This review discusses the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of cardiogenic shock associated with acute myocardial infarction.","[Samsky, Marc D.; Rao, Sunil V.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Duke Clin Res Inst, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Morrow, David A.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Harvard Med Sch, Cardiovasc Div, TIMI Study Grp, Boston, MA USA; [Proudfoot, Alastair G.] St Bartholomews Hosp, Barts Heart Ctr, Perioperat Med Dept, London, England; [Proudfoot, Alastair G.] Univ Berlin, Charite Univmed Berlin Corp member Fre, Clin Anesthesiol & Intens Care, Berlin, Germany; [Proudfoot, Alastair G.] German Heart Ctr Berlin, Dept Anaesthesiol & Intens Care, Berlin, Germany; [Hochman, Judith S.] NYU, Grossman Sch Med, Cardiovasc Clin Res Ctr, Dept Med,Div Cardiol, New York, NY USA; [Thiele, Holger] Univ Leipzig, Heart Ctr Leipzig, Leipzig Heart Inst, Dept Internal Med, Leipzig, Germany",,"Rao, SV (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Sch Med, Duke Clin Res Inst, Durham, NC 27706 USA.;Rao, SV (corresponding author), Duke Univ Hlth Syst, 508 Fulton St,111A, Durham, NC 27705 USA.",sunil.rao@duke.edu,,,NHLBI NIH HHS [T32 HL069749] Funding Source: Medline,NHLBI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI)),,,62,13,13,13,24,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

S1P receptors (S1PRs) have been proposed as a therapeutic target for various diseases due to their involvement in regulation of lymphocyte trafficking, brain and cardiac function, vascular permeability, and vascular and bronchial tone. S1PR modulators were first developed to prevent rejection by the immune system following renal transplantation, but the only currently approved indication is multiple sclerosis. The primary mechanism of action of S1PR modulators in multiple sclerosis is through binding S1PR subtype 1 on lymphocytes resulting in internalisation of the receptor and loss of responsiveness to the S1P gradient that drives lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes. The reduction in circulating lymphocytes presumably limits inflammatory cell migration into the CNS. Four S1PR modulators (fingolimod, siponimod, ozanimod, and ponesimod) have regulatory approval for multiple sclerosis. Preclinical evidence and ongoing and completed clinical trials support development of S1PR modulators for other therapeutic indications.","[McGinley, Marisa P.; Cohen, Jeffrey A.] Cleveland Clin, Mellen Ctr, U-10, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA",,"Cohen, JA (corresponding author), Cleveland Clin, Mellen Ctr, U-10, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA.",cohenj@ccf.org,,,,,,,90,15,15,8,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,SEP 25,2021,398,10306,,,,,1184,1194,,10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00244-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00244-0,,SEP 2021,11,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,UX3WV,34175020,,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000700774500028,View Full Record in Web of Science,76570,0,82,76,74,38,41,88,30,24,61,51,7,46,15,72,84

In this Series paper, we present the progress that has been made in the search for biomarkers of migraine within genetics, provocation modelling, biochemistry, and neuroimaging research. Additionally, we outline challenges and future directions for each biomarker modality. We also discuss the advances made in combining and integrating data from multiple biomarker modalities.

FindingsIn this systematic review and network meta-analysis that included 25 studies and 3804 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, compared with standard oxygen therapy there was a statistically significant lower risk of death with helmet noninvasive ventilation (risk ratio, 0.40) and face mask noninvasive ventilation (risk ratio, 0.83). MeaningNoninvasive oxygenation strategies compared with standard oxygen therapy were significantly associated with lower risk of death. ImportanceTreatment with noninvasive oxygenation strategies such as noninvasive ventilation and high-flow nasal oxygen may be more effective than standard oxygen therapy alone in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. ObjectiveTo compare the association of noninvasive oxygenation strategies with mortality and endotracheal intubation in adults with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Data SourcesThe following bibliographic databases were searched from inception until April 2020: MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Web of Science, and LILACS. No limits were applied to language, publication year, sex, or race. Study SelectionRandomized clinical trials enrolling adult participants with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure comparing high-flow nasal oxygen, face mask noninvasive ventilation, helmet noninvasive ventilation, or standard oxygen therapy. Data Extraction and SynthesisTwo reviewers independently extracted individual study data and evaluated studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Network meta-analyses using a bayesian framework to derive risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences along with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) were conducted. GRADE methodology was used to rate the certainty in findings. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was all-cause mortality up to 90 days. A secondary outcome was endotracheal intubation up to 30 days. ResultsTwenty-five randomized clinical trials (3804 participants) were included. Compared with standard oxygen, treatment with helmet noninvasive ventilation (RR, 0.40 [95% CrI, 0.24-0.63]; absolute risk difference, -0.19 [95% CrI, -0.37 to -0.09]; low certainty) and face mask noninvasive ventilation (RR, 0.83 [95% CrI, 0.68-0.99]; absolute risk difference, -0.06 [95% CrI, -0.15 to -0.01]; moderate certainty) were associated with a lower risk of mortality (21 studies [3370 patients]). Helmet noninvasive ventilation (RR, 0.26 [95% CrI, 0.14-0.46]; absolute risk difference, -0.32 [95% CrI, -0.60 to -0.16]; low certainty), face mask noninvasive ventilation (RR, 0.76 [95% CrI, 0.62-0.90]; absolute risk difference, -0.12 [95% CrI, -0.25 to -0.05]; moderate certainty) and high-flow nasal oxygen (RR, 0.76 [95% CrI, 0.55-0.99]; absolute risk difference, -0.11 [95% CrI, -0.27 to -0.01]; moderate certainty) were associated with lower risk of endotracheal intubation (25 studies [3804 patients]). The risk of bias due to lack of blinding for intubation was deemed high. Conclusions and RelevanceIn this network meta-analysis of trials of adult patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, treatment with noninvasive oxygenation strategies compared with standard oxygen therapy was associated with lower risk of death. Further research is needed to better understand the relative benefits of each strategy. This network meta-analysis of randomized trials estimates association of use of noninvasive ventilation (high-flow nasal oxygen; face mask or helmet noninvasive ventilation) vs standard oxygen therapy with mortality and endotracheal intubation among adults with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.","[Ferreyro, Bruno L.; Angriman, Federico; Del Sorbo, Lorenzo; Ferguson, Niall D.; Wunsch, Hannah; Scales, Damon C.] Univ Toronto, Interdept Div Crit Care Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Ferreyro, Bruno L.; Angriman, Federico; Munshi, Laveena; Ferguson, Niall D.; Wunsch, Hannah; da Costa, Bruno R.; Scales, Damon C.] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Ferreyro, Bruno L.; Munshi, Laveena; Ferguson, Niall D.] Sinai Hlth Syst, Dept Med, 600 Univ Ave,Room 18-210, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada; [Ferreyro, Bruno L.; Munshi, Laveena; Ferguson, Niall D.] Univ Hlth Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Angriman, Federico; Wunsch, Hannah; Scales, Damon C.] Sunnybrook Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Crit Care Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Del Sorbo, Lorenzo] Univ Hlth Network, Dept Med, Div Respirol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Del Sorbo, Lorenzo] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Rochwerg, Bram] McMaster Univ, Dept Med, Div Crit Care, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Rochwerg, Bram] McMaster Univ, Dept Hlth Res Methods Evidence & Impact, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Ryu, Michelle J.] Mt Sinai Hosp, Sidney Liswood Hlth Sci Lib, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Saskin, Refik; Wunsch, Hannah; Scales, Damon C.] Inst Clin Evaluat Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [da Costa, Bruno R.; Scales, Damon C.] St Michaels Hosp, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Inst, Appl Hlth Res Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada; [da Costa, Bruno R.] Univ Bern, Inst Primary Hlth Care BIHAM, Bern, Switzerland",,"Ferreyro, BL (corresponding author), Sinai Hlth Syst, Dept Med, 600 Univ Ave,Room 18-210, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada.;Ferreyro, BL (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Interdept Div Crit Care Med, Univ Hlth Network, 600 Univ Ave,Room 18-210, Toronto, ON M5G 1X5, Canada.",bruno.ferreyro@uhn.ca,"Ferguson, Niall/D-7619-2019","Ferguson, Niall/0000-0002-6213-5264; Angriman, Federico/0000-0003-0971-386X; Ryu, Michelle/0000-0003-0499-6856","Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship; Department of Critical Care Medicine, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre; Hamilton Health Sciences Early Career Research Award; Canadian Institute for Health Research","Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship; Department of Critical Care Medicine, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre(University of Toronto); Hamilton Health Sciences Early Career Research Award; Canadian Institute for Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR))","Dr Ferreyro is supported by a Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship.

OBJECTIVE To review the evidence on screening asymptomatic adults for CVD risk using electrocardiography (ECG) to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries through May 2017; references; experts; literature surveillance through April 4, 2018. STUDY SELECTION English-language randomized clinical trials (RCTs); prospective cohort studies reporting reclassification, calibration, or discrimination that compared risk assessment using ECG plus traditional risk factors vs traditional risk factors alone. For harms, additional study designs were eligible. Studies of persons with symptoms or a CVD diagnosis were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality; qualitative synthesis of findings. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mortality, cardiovascular events, reclassification, calibration, discrimination, and harms. RESULTS Sixteen studies were included (N = 77 140). Two RCTs (n = 1151) found no significant improvement for screening with exercise ECG (vs no screening) in adults aged 50 to 75 years with diabetes for the primary cardiovascular composite outcomes (hazard ratios, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.59-1.71] and 0.85 [95% CI, 0.39-1.84] for each study). No RCTs evaluated screening with resting ECG. Evidence from 5 cohort studies (n = 9582) showed that adding exercise ECG to traditional risk factors such as age, sex, current smoking, diabetes, total cholesterol level, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level produced small improvements in discrimination (absolute improvements in area under the curve [AUC] or C statistics, 0.02-0.03, reported by 3 studies); whether calibration or appropriate risk classification improves is uncertain. Evidence from 9 cohort studies (n = 66 407) showed that adding resting ECG to traditional risk factors produced small improvements in discrimination (absolute improvement in AUC or C statistics, 0.001-0.05) and appropriate risk classification for prediction of multiple cardiovascular outcomes, although evidence was limited by imprecision, quality, considerable heterogeneity, and inconsistent use of risk thresholds used for clinical decision making. Total net reclassification improvements ranged from 3.6%(2.7% event; 0.6% nonevent) to30%(17% event; 19% nonevent) for studies using the Framingham Risk Score or Pooled Cohort Equations base models. Evidence on potential harms (eg, from subsequent angiography or revascularization) in asymptomatic persons was limited. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE RCTs of screening with exercise ECG found no improvement in health outcomes, despite focusing on higher-risk populations with diabetes. The addition of resting ECG to traditional risk factors accurately reclassified persons, but evidence for this finding had many limitations. The frequency of harms from screening is uncertain.","[Jonas, Daniel E.; Reddy, Shivani; Middleton, Jennifer Cook; Barclay, Colleen; Green, Joshua; Baker, Claire] RTI Int Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Jonas, Daniel E.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Med, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Jonas, Daniel E.; Middleton, Jennifer Cook; Barclay, Colleen; Baker, Claire; Asher, Gary N.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Cecil G Sheps Ctr Hlth Serv Res, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Reddy, Shivani; Green, Joshua] RTI Int, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Asher, Gary N.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Family Med, Chapel Hill, NC USA",,"Jonas, DE (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, 5034 Old Clin Bldg, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",daniel_jonas@med.unc.edu,,"Reddy, Shivani/0000-0003-2803-6155","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA-290-2015-00011-I, 5]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA-290-2015-00011-I, Task Order 5, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the USPSTF.",,40,29,30,1,5,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

For some patients, technological approaches to insulin delivery are inadequate, and allogeneic islet transplantation is a safe alternative for those patients who have had severe hypoglycaemia complicated by impaired hypoglycaemia awareness or glycaemic lability, or who already receive immunosuppressive drugs for a kidney transplant. Since 2000, intrahepatic islet transplantation has proven efficacious in alleviating the burden of labile diabetes and preventing complications related to diabetes, whether or not a previous kidney transplant is present. Age, body-mass index, renal status, and cardiopulmonary status affect the choice between pancreas or islet transplantation. Access to transplantation is limited by the number of deceased donors and the necessity of immunosuppression. Future approaches might include alternative sources of islets (eg, xenogeneic tissue or human stem cells), extrahepatic sites of implantation (eg, omental, subcutaneous, or intra-muscular), and induction of immune tolerance or encapsulation of islets.","[Vantyghem, Marie-Christine; Pattou, Francois] Univ Lille, European Genom Inst Diabet, Lille, France; [Vantyghem, Marie-Christine] CHU Lille, Dept Endocrinol Diabetol & Metab, F-59037 Lille, France; [Pattou, Francois] CHU Lille, Dept Gen & Endocrine Surg Ctr, Lille, France; [Vantyghem, Marie-Christine; Pattou, Francois] INSERM, Translat Res Diabet, Lille, France; [de Koning, Eelco J.

Unlike sequence information, which is inherited, methylation patterns are established in a programmed process that continues throughout development, thus setting up stable gene expression profiles. This DNA methylation paradigm is a key player in medicine. Some changes in methylation closely correlate with age providing a marker for biological ageing, and these same sites could also play a part in cancer. The genome continues to undergo programmed variation in methylation after birth in response to environmental inputs, serving as a memory device that could affect ageing and predisposition to various metabolic, autoimmune, and neurological diseases. Taking advantage of tissue-specific differences, methylation can be used to detect cell death and thereby monitor many common diseases with a simple cell-free circulating-DNA blood test.","[Dor, Yuval; Cedar, Howard] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fac Med, Dept Dev Biol & Canc Res, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel",,"Cedar, H (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fac Med, Dept Dev Biol & Canc Res, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel.",cedar@mail.huji.ac.il,,,Rosetrees Foundation; Israel Cancer Research Fund; Israel Science Foundation; Smart Foundation; Lew Sanders; Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,Rosetrees Foundation(Rosetrees Trust); Israel Cancer Research Fund; Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation); Smart Foundation; Lew Sanders; Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation(Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)),"The following research grants contributed to the evolution, organisation, and writing of this Review: Rosetrees Foundation, the Israel Cancer Research Fund, the Israel Science Foundation, the Smart Foundation, Lew Sanders, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases-supported Human Islet Research Network.",,100,221,240,21,120,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,SEP 1,2018,392,10149,,,,,777,786,,10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31268-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31268-6,,,10,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,GS0VL,30100054,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000443226900029,View Full Record in Web of Science,77289,0,96,36,49,71,15,100,91,100,70,66,58,42,87,11,59

Optimal treatment of an individual with a pulmonary nodule can lead to early detection of cancer while minimizing testing for a benign nodule. OBSERVATIONS At least 95% of all pulmonary nodules identified are benign, most often granulomas or intrapulmonary lymph nodes. Smaller nodules are more likely to be benign. Pulmonary nodules are categorized as small solid (<8 mm), larger solid (>= 8 mm), and subsolid. Subsolid nodules are divided into ground-glass nodules (no solid component) and part-solid (both ground-glass and solid components). The probability of malignancy is less than 1% for all nodules smaller than 6 mm and 1% to 2% for nodules 6 mm to 8 mm. Nodules that are 6 mm to 8 mm can be followed with a repeat chest CT in 6 to 12 months, depending on the presence of patient risk factors and imaging characteristics associated with lung malignancy, clinical judgment about the probability of malignancy, and patient preferences. The treatment of an individual with a solid pulmonary nodule 8 mm or larger is based on the estimated probability of malignancy; the presence of patient comorbidities, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease; and patient preferences. Management options include surveillance imaging, defined as monitoring for nodule growth with chest CT imaging, positron emission tomography-CT imaging, nonsurgical biopsy with bronchoscopy or transthoracic needle biopsy, and surgical resection. Part-solid pulmonary nodules are managed according to the size of the solid component. Larger solid components are associated with a higher risk of malignancy. Ground-glass pulmonary nodules have a probability of malignancy of 10% to 50% when they persist beyond 3 months and are larger than 10 mm in diameter. A malignant nodule that is entirely ground glass in appearance is typically slow growing. Current bronchoscopy and transthoracic needle biopsy methods yield a sensitivity of 70% to 90% for a diagnosis of lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Pulmonary nodules are identified in approximately 1.6 million people per year in the US and approximately 30% of chest CT images. The treatment of an individual with a pulmonary nodule should be guided by the probability that the nodule is malignant, safety of testing, the likelihood that additional testing will be informative, and patient preferences.","[Mazzone, Peter J.; Lam, Louis] Cleveland Clin, Resp Inst, 9500 Euclid Ave,A90, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA",,"Mazzone, PJ (corresponding author), Cleveland Clin, Resp Inst, 9500 Euclid Ave,A90, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA.",mazzonp@ccf.org,,,,,,,51,1,1,23,23,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

We sought to update WHO estimates for the prevalence of mental disorders in conflict-affected settings and calculate the burden per 1000 population. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we updated a previous systematic review by searching MEDLINE (PubMed), PsycINFO, and Embase for studies published between Jan 1, 2000, and Aug 9, 2017, on the prevalence of depression, anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. We also searched the grey literature, such as government reports, conference proceedings, and dissertations, to source additional data, and we searched datasets from existing literature reviews of the global prevalence of depression and anxiety and reference lists from the studies that were identified. We applied the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting and used Bayesian meta-regression techniques that adjust for predictors of mental disorders to calculate new point prevalence estimates with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) in settings that had experienced conflict less than 10 years previously. Findings We estimated that the prevalence of mental disorders (depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia) was 22.1% (95% UI 18.8-25.7) at any point in time in the conflict-affected populations assessed. The mean comorbidity-adjusted, age-standardised point prevalence was 13.0% (95% UI 10.3-16.2) for mild forms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder and 4.0% (95% UI 2.9-5.5) for moderate forms. The mean comorbidity-adjusted, age-standardised point prevalence for severe disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, severe depression, severe anxiety, and severe post-traumatic stress disorder) was 5.1% (95% UI 4.0-6.5). As only two studies provided epidemiological data for psychosis in conflict-affected populations, existing Global Burden of Disease Study estimates for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder were applied in these estimates for conflict-affected populations. Interpretation The burden of mental disorders is high in conflict-affected populations. Given the large numbers of people in need and the humanitarian imperative to reduce suffering, there is an urgent need to implement scalable mental health interventions to address this burden.

Objective To compare clinical outcomes between patients receiving radial artery vs saphenous vein grafts for coronary artery bypass grafting after long-term follow-up. Design, Setting, and Participants Patient-level pooled analysis comparing radial artery vs saphenous vein graft in adult patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting from 5 countries (Australia, Italy, Serbia, South Korea, and the United Kingdom), with enrollment from 1997 to 2009 and follow-up completed in 2019. Interventions Patients were randomized to undergo either radial artery (n = 534) or saphenous vein (n = 502) grafts for coronary artery bypass grafting. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, or repeat revascularization and the secondary outcome was a composite of death or myocardial infarction. Results A total of 1036 patients were randomized (mean age, 66.6 years in the radial artery group vs 67.1 years in the saphenous vein group; 376 [70.4%] men in the radial artery group vs 351 [69.9%] in the saphenous vein group); 942 (90.9%) of the originally randomized patients completed 10 years of follow-up (510 in the radial artery group). At a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 10 (10-11) years, the use of the radial artery, compared with the saphenous vein, in coronary artery bypass grafting was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of the composite outcome of death, myocardial infarction, or repeat revascularization (220 vs 237 total events; 41 vs 47 events per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.61-0.88]; P < .001) and of the composite of death or myocardial infarction (188 vs 193 total events; 35 vs 38 events per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.63-0.94]; P = .01). Conclusions and Relevance In this individual participant data meta-analysis with a median follow-up of 10 years, among patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, the use of the radial artery compared with the saphenous vein was associated with a lower risk of a composite of cardiovascular outcomes. This meta-analysis uses individual participant data from clinical trials to estimate associations between radial artery vs saphenous vein grafting techniques and cardiovascular outcomes at 10 years among patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Question Is the use of the radial artery instead of the saphenous vein for coronary artery bypass surgery associated with a lower risk of adverse cardiac events in the long term? Findings In this individual participant data meta-analysis from 5 randomized clinical trials that included 1036 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, randomization to receive radial artery compared with saphenous vein graft was associated with an incidence of a composite of death, myocardial infarction, or repeat revascularization of 41 vs 47 events per 1000 person-years after a median follow-up of 10 years, a difference that was statistically significant. Meaning Over 10 years of follow-up, radial artery graft compared with saphenous vein graft was associated with a lower risk of a composite of cardiovascular outcomes.","[Gaudino, Mario; Hameed, Irbaz; Di Franco, Antonino; Girardi, Leonard N.] Weill Cornell Med, Dept Cardiothorac Surg, 525 E 68th St, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Benedetto, Umberto] Bristol Heart Inst, Dept Cardiac Surg, Bristol, Avon, England; [Fremes, Stephen] Univ Toronto, Dept Surg, Schulich Heart Ctr, Sunnybrook Hlth Sci Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Ballman, Karla; Sedrakyan, Art] Weill Cornell Med, Dept Healthcare Policy & Res, New York, NY USA; [Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe] Sapienza Univ, Dept Med Surg Sci & Biotechnol, Rome, Italy; [Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe] Mediterranea Cardioctr, Naples, Italy; [Nasso, Giuseppe; Moscarelli, Marco; Speziale, Giuseppe] Maria Cecilia Hosp, Cardiothorac & Vasc Dept, GVM Care & Res, Cotignola, RA, Italy; [Raman, Jai] Austin Hosp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Raman, Jai; Buxton, Brian; Hayward, Philip A.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Surg, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Moat, Neil; Collins, Peter; Webb, Carolyn] Imperial Coll London, Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Fdn Trust, NHLI, London, England; [Peric, Miodrag; Petrovic, Ivana] Dedinje Cardiovasc Inst, Belgrade, Serbia; [Peric, Miodrag; Petrovic, Ivana] Univ Belgrade, Sch Med, Belgrade, Serbia; [Yoo, Kyung J.] Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Puskas, John D.] Mt Sinai St Lukes, Dept Cardiovasc Surg, New York, NY USA; [Hare, David L.] Univ Melbourne, Fac Med Dent & Hlth Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Hare, David L.] Austin Hlth, Dept Cardiol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Taggart, David P.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Surg Sci, Oxford, England",,"Gaudino, M (corresponding author), Weill Cornell Med, Dept Cardiothorac Surg, 525 E 68th St, New York, NY 10065 USA.",mfg9004@med.cornell.edu,"Nasso, Giuseppe/AAS-7579-2020; Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe/C-9670-2012","Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe/0000-0001-6103-8510; Demetres, Michelle/0000-0002-4997-7707; Nasso, Giuseppe/0000-0002-3519-770X; Moscarelli, Marco/0000-0002-8373-8486; Benedetto, Umberto/0000-0002-7074-7949; Webb, Carolyn/0000-0002-2538-6953",Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York; Bernard S.

The effectiveness of contact investigations and preventive therapy remains poorly understood. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we investigated the development of tuberculosis in children closely exposed to a tuberculosis case and followed for incident disease. We restricted our search to cohort studies published between Jan 1, 1998, and April 6, 2018, in MEDLINE, Web of Science, BIOSIS, and Embase electronic databases. Individual-participant data and a pre-specified list of variables were requested from authors of all eligible studies. These included characteristics of the exposed child, the index case, and environmental characteristics. To be eligible for inclusion in the final analysis, a dataset needed to include: (1) individuals below 19 years of age; (2) follow-up for tuberculosis for a minimum of 6 months; (3) individuals with household or close exposure to an individual with tuberculosis; (4) information on the age and sex of the child; and (5) start and end follow-up dates. Studies assessing incident tuberculosis but without dates or time of follow-up were excluded. Our analysis had two primary aims: (1) estimating the risk of developing tuberculosis by time-period of follow-up, demographics (age, region), and clinical attributes (HIV, tuberculosis infection status, previous tuberculosis); and (2) estimating the effectiveness of preventive therapy and BCG vaccination on the risk of developing tuberculosis. We estimated the odds of prevalent tuberculosis with mixed-effects logistic models and estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for incident tuberculosis with mixed-effects Poisson regression models. The effectiveness of preventive therapy against incident tuberculosis was estimated through propensity score matching. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018087022). Findings In total, study groups from 46 cohort studies in 34 countries-29 (63%) prospective studies and 17 (37%) retrospective-agreed to share their data and were included in the final analysis. 137 647 tuberculosis-exposed children were evaluated at baseline and 130 512 children were followed for 429 538 person-years, during which 1299 prevalent and 999 incident tuberculosis cases were diagnosed. Children not receiving preventive therapy with a positive result for tuberculosis infection had significantly higher 2-year cumulative tuberculosis incidence than children with a negative result for tuberculosis infection, and this incidence was greatest among children below 5 years of age (19.0% [95% CI 8.4-37.4]). The effectiveness of preventive therapy was 63% (adjusted HR 0.37 [95% CI 0.30-0.47]) among all exposed children, and 91% (adjusted HR 0.09 [0.05-0.15]) among those with a positive result for tuberculosis infection. Among all children <5 years of age who developed tuberculosis, 83% were diagnosed within 90 days of the baseline visit. Interpretation The risk of developing tuberculosis among exposed infants and young children is very high. Most cases occurred within weeks of contact investigation initiation and might not be preventable through prophylaxis. This suggests that alternative strategies for prevention are needed, such as earlier initiation of preventive therapy through rapid diagnosis of adult cases or community-wide screening approaches.

Many patients report allergies to these drugs that limit their use, resulting in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that increase the risk for antimicrobial resistance and adverse events. OBSERVATIONS Approximately 10% of the US population has reported allergies to the beta-lactam agent penicillin, with higher rates reported by older and hospitalized patients. Although many patients report that they are allergic to penicillin, clinically significant IgE-mediated or T lymphocyte-mediated penicillin hypersensitivity is uncommon (< 5%). Currently, the rate of IgE-mediated penicillin allergies is decreasing, potentially due to a decreased use of parenteral penicillins, and because severe anaphylactic reactions to oral amoxicillin are rare. IgE-mediated penicillin allergy wanes over time, with 80% of patients becoming tolerant after a decade. Cross-reactivity between penicillin and cephalosporin drugs occurs in about 2% of cases, less than the 8% reported previously. Some patients have a medical history that suggests they are at a low risk for developing an allergic reaction to penicillin. Low-risk histories include patients having isolated nonallergic symptoms, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, or patients solely with a family history of a penicillin allergy, symptoms of pruritus without rash, or remote (> 10 years) unknown reactions without features suggestive of an IgE-mediated reaction. A moderate-risk history includes urticaria or other pruritic rashes and reactions with features of IgE-mediated reactions. A high-risk history includes patients who have had anaphylaxis, positive penicillin skin testing, recurrent penicillin reactions, or hypersensitivities to multiple beta-lactam antibiotics. The goals of antimicrobial stewardship are undermined when reported allergy to penicillin leads to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that increase the risk for antimicrobial resistance, including increased risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents also increase the risk of developing Clostridium difficile (also known as Clostridioides difficile) infection. Direct amoxicillin challenge is appropriate for patients with low-risk allergy histories. Moderate-risk patients can be evaluated with penicillin skin testing, which carries a negative predictive value that exceeds 95% and approaches 100% when combined with amoxicillin challenge. Clinicians performing penicillin allergy evaluation need to identify what methods are supported by their available resources. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Many patients report they are allergic to penicillin but few have clinically significant reactions. Evaluation of penicillin allergy before deciding not to use penicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics is an important tool for antimicrobial stewardship.","[Shenoy, Erica S.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Infect Control Unit, 55 Fruit St,Bulfinch 332, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Shenoy, Erica S.; Blumenthal, Kimberly G.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA USA; [Shenoy, Erica S.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Med, Div Infect Dis, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Macy, Eric] San Diego Med Ctr, Dept Allergy, Southern Calif Permanente Med Grp, San Diego, CA USA; [Rowe, Theresa] Northwestern Univ, Gen Internal Med & Geriatr, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Blumenthal, Kimberly G.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Med, Div Rheumatol Allergy & Immunol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Blumenthal, Kimberly G.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Edward P Lawrence Ctr Qual & Safety, Boston, MA 02114 USA",,"Shenoy, ES (corresponding author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Infect Control Unit, 55 Fruit St,Bulfinch 332, Boston, MA 02114 USA.",eshenoy@mgh.harvard.edu,"Blumenthal, Kimberly G./AAG-8290-2019; Shenoy, Erica/AAD-7521-2021",,,,,,107,219,223,14,93,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Diagnosis rates are increasing, and this seems to be due to a true rise in incidence rather than increased awareness and detection. Coeliac disease develops in genetically susceptible individuals who, in response to unknown environmental factors, develop an immune response that is subsequently triggered by the ingestion of gluten. The disease has many clinical manifestations, ranging from severe malabsorption to minimally symptomatic or non-symptomatic presentations. Diagnosis requires the presence of duodenal villous atrophy, and most patients have circulating antibodies against tissue transglutaminase; in children, European guidelines allow a diagnosis without a duodenal biopsy provided that strict symptomatic and serological criteria are met. Although a gluten-free diet is an effective treatment in most individuals, a substantial minority develop persistent or recurrent symptoms. Difficulties adhering to a gluten-free diet have led to the development of non-dietary therapies, several of which are undergoing trials in human beings.","[Lebwohl, Benjamin; Green, Peter H.

By contrast, the role of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is controversial. Early trials evaluating aspirin for primary prevention, done before the turn of the millennium, suggested reductions in myocardial infarction and stroke (although not mortality), and an increased risk of bleeding. In an effort to balance the risks and benefits of aspirin, international guidelines on primary prevention of cardiovascular disease have typically recommended aspirin only when a substantial 10-year risk of cardiovascular events exists. However, in 2018, three large randomised clinical trials of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease showed little or no benefit and have even suggested net harm. In this narrative Review, we reappraise the role of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, contextualising data from historical and contemporary trials.","[Raber, Inbar] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Med, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [McCarthy, Cian P.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Med, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Vaduganathan, Muthiah; Bhatt, Deepak L.] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Heart & Vasc Ctr, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Wood, David A.; McEvoy, John W.] Natl Univ Ireland, Natl Inst Prevent & Cardiovasc Hlth, Galway H91 FF68, Ireland; [Wood, David A.; Cleland, John G.

Even when active-comparator trials exist, they might not produce meaningful data to inform decisions in clinical practice and health policy. The uncertainty associated with the paucity of well designed active-comparator trials has been compounded by legal and regulatory changes in Europe and the USA that have created a complex mix of expedited programmes aimed at facilitating faster access to new drugs. Comparative evidence generation is even sparser for medical devices. Some have argued that the current process for regulatory approval needs to generate more evidence that is useful for patients, clinicians, and payers in health-care systems. We propose a set of five key principles relevant to the European Medicines Agency, European medical device regulatory agencies, US Food and Drug Administration, as well as payers, that we believe will provide the necessary incentives for pharmaceutical and device companies to generate comparative data on drugs and devices and assure timely availability of evidence that is useful for decision making. First, labelling should routinely inform patients and clinicians whether comparative data exist on new products. Second, regulators should be more selective in their use of programmes that facilitate drug and device approvals on the basis of incomplete benefit and harm data. Third, regulators should encourage the conduct of randomised trials with active comparators. Fourth, regulators should use prospectively designed network meta-analyses based on existing and future randomised trials.

In general, infection accounts for approximately one-fourth of cases of FUO, followed by neoplasm and noninfectious inflammatory diseases. No diagnosis is reached in up to 50% of cases. Scintigraphic methods, such as (67)Ga-citrate, labeled leukocytes, and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), are often used in the diagnosis of FUO. In FUO, FDG-PET appears to be of great advantage because malignancy, inflammation, and infection can be detected. FDG-PET does not seem to contribute to a final diagnosis in patients with normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. Image fusion combining PET and computed tomography facilitates anatomical localization of increased FDG uptake and better guiding for further diagnostic tests to achieve a final diagnosis. In conclusion, the body of evidence on the utility of FDG-PET in patients with FUO is growing and FDG-PET will probably become the preferred diagnostic procedure, especially when a definite diagnosis cannot easily be achieved. Because of favorable characteristics of FDG-PET, conventional scintigraphic techniques may be replaced by FDG-PET in institutions in which PET is available.","[Haidar, Ghady] Univ Pittsburgh, Div Infect Dis, Dept Med, Sch Med, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Singh, Nina] VA Healthcare Syst, Infect Dis Sect, Univ Dr C, Pittsburgh, PA 15240 USA",,"Singh, N (corresponding author), VA Healthcare Syst, Infect Dis Sect, Univ Dr C, Pittsburgh, PA 15240 USA.",nis5@pitt.edu,,,,,,,75,4,4,19,19,MASSACHUSETTS MEDICAL SOC,WALTHAM,"WALTHAM WOODS CENTER, 860 WINTER ST,, WALTHAM, MA 02451-1413 USA",0028-4793,1533-4406,,NEW ENGL J MED,N.

Militaries have many capabilities applicable to global health, ranging from research, surveillance, and medical expertise to rapidly deployable, large-scale assets for logistics, transportation, and security. Despite this large range of capabilities, militaries also have limitations when engaging in global health activities. Militaries focus on strategic, operational, and tactical objectives that support their security and defence missions, which can conflict with humanitarian and global health equity objectives. Guidelines both within and outside militaries for military engagement in global health are often lacking, as are structured opportunities for military and civilian organisations to engage one another. We summarise policies that can help close the gap between military and civilian actors to catalyse the contributions of all participants to enhance global health.","[Michaud, Joshua; Moss, Kellie] Henry J Kaiser Family Fdn, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Michaud, Joshua] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Adv Int Studies, Washington, DC USA; [Licina, Derek] US Army, Reg Hlth Command Pacific, Honolulu, HI USA; [Waldman, Ron] George Washington Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Milken Inst, Washington, DC USA; [Kamradt-Scott, Adam] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Bartee, Maureen] US Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Ctr Global Hlth, Atlanta, GA USA; [Lim, Matthew] US Naval Med Res Ctr, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Williamson, Jamie] Int Comm Red Cross, Geneva, Switzerland; [Burkle, Frederick] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Harvard Humanitarian Initiat, Boston, MA USA; [Polyak, Christina S.] US Mil HIV Res Program, Bethesda, MD USA; [Polyak, Christina S.] Henry Jackson Fdn, Bethesda, MD USA; [Thomson, Nicholas] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Nossal Inst Global Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Thomson, Nicholas] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Publ Hlth & Human Rights, Baltimore, MD USA; [Heymann, David L.; Lillywhite, Louis] Chatham House Royal Inst Int Affairs, London, England; [Lillywhite, Louis] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London, England",,"Michaud, J (corresponding author), Henry J Kaiser Family Fdn, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",jmichaud@kff.org,"Burkle, Frederick/AAE-5423-2020; Kamradt-Scott, Adam/B-9205-2013; Lillywhite, Louis P/A-1879-2019","Kamradt-Scott, Adam/0000-0002-4901-4898; Lillywhite, Louis P/0000-0001-5328-6805",,,,,127,29,30,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,JAN 19,2019,393,10168,,,,,276,286,,10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32838-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32838-1,,,11,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),General & Internal Medicine,HH8RN,30663597,,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000456000000031,View Full Record in Web of Science,80349,0,97,86,43,24,28,20,40,84,64,26,103,37,119,46,43

It is a complication in approximately 4% of pregnancies in the US and contributes to both maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. Preeclampsia also accounts for 6% of preterm births and 19% of medically indicated preterm births in the US. There are racial and ethnic disparities in the prevalence of and mortality from preeclampsia. Non-Hispanic Black women are at greater risk for developing preeclampsia than other women and experience higher rates of maternal and infant morbidity and perinatal mortality. Objective To update its 2014 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia. Population Pregnant persons at high risk for preeclampsia who have no prior adverse effects with or contraindications to low-dose aspirin. Evidence Assessment The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a substantial net benefit of daily low-dose aspirin use to reduce the risk for preeclampsia, preterm birth, small for gestational age/intrauterine growth restriction, and perinatal mortality in pregnant persons at high risk for preeclampsia. Recommendation The USPSTF recommends the use of low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) as preventive medication for preeclampsia after 12 weeks of gestation in persons who are at high risk for preeclampsia. (B recommendation) This 2021 Recommendation Statement from the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends the use of low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) as preventive medication for preeclampsia after 12 weeks of gestation in persons at high risk for preeclampsia (B recommendation).","[Davidson, Karina W.] Northwell Hlth, Feinstein Inst Med Res, 130 59th St,Ste 14C, Manhasset, NY 10032 USA; [Barry, Michael J.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Mangione, Carol M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Cabana, Michael] Albert Einstein Coll Med, New York, NY USA; [Caughey, Aaron B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Davis, Esa M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Donahue, Katrina E.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Doubeni, Chyke A.] Mayo Clin, Rochester, MN USA; [Kubik, Martha] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Li, Li] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Ogedegbe, Gbenga] NYU, New York, NY USA; [Pbert, Lori] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Silverstein, Michael] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Simon, Melissa A.] Northwestern Univ, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Stevermer, James] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Univ Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Pacific Hlth Res & Educ Inst, Honolulu, HI USA; [Wong, John B.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02111 USA",,"Davidson, KW (corresponding author), Northwell Hlth, Feinstein Inst Med Res, 130 59th St,Ste 14C, Manhasset, NY 10032 USA.",chair@uspstf.net,,,,,,,21,17,18,3,4,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

This review discusses current evidence regarding the pathophysiology, transmission, diagnosis, and management of COVID-19. OBSERVATIONS SARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily via respiratory droplets during close face-to-face contact. Infection can be spread by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic carriers. The average time from exposure to symptom onset is 5 days, and 97.5% of people who develop symptoms do so within 11.5 days. The most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Radiographic and laboratory abnormalities, such as lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, are common, but nonspecific. Diagnosis is made by detection of SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing, although false-negative test results may occur in up to 20% to 67% of patients; however, this is dependent on the quality and timing of testing. Manifestations of COVID-19 include asymptomatic carriers and fulminant disease characterized by sepsis and acute respiratory failure. Approximately 5% of patients with COVID-19, and 20% of those hospitalized, experience severe symptoms necessitating intensive care. More than 75% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 require supplemental oxygen. Treatment for individuals with COVID-19 includes best practices for supportive management of acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Emerging data indicate that dexamethasone therapy reduces 28-day mortality in patients requiring supplemental oxygen compared with usual care (21.6% vs 24.6%; age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.74-0.92]) and that remdesivir improves time to recovery (hospital discharge or no supplemental oxygen requirement) from 15 to 11 days. In a randomized trial of 103 patients with COVID-19, convalescent plasma did not shorten time to recovery. Ongoing trials are testing antiviral therapies, immune modulators, and anticoagulants. The case-fatality rate for COVID-19 varies markedly by age, ranging from 0.3 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 5 to 17 years to 304.9 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 85 years or older in the US. Among patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, the case fatality is up to 40%. At least 120 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are under development. Until an effective vaccine is available, the primary methods to reduce spread are face masks, social distancing, and contact tracing. Monoclonal antibodies and hyperimmune globulin may provide additional preventive strategies. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE As of July 1, 2020, more than 10 million people worldwide had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Many aspects of transmission, infection, and treatment remain unclear. Advances in prevention and effective management of COVID-19 will require basic and clinical investigation and public health and clinical interventions. This narrative review discusses what is currently known about the pathophysiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, management, prognosis, and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","[Wiersinga, W.

Estimates of the risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes vary widely, perhaps because of differences in the definition of prediabetes or the heterogeneity of prediabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure and new cases of blindness among adults in the US. It is also associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and was estimated to be the seventh leading cause of death in the US in 2017. Screening asymptomatic adults for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes may allow earlier detection, diagnosis, and treatment, with the ultimate goal of improving health outcomes. ObjectiveTo update its 2015 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults and preventive interventions for those with prediabetes. PopulationNonpregnant adults aged 35 to 70 years seen in primary care settings who have overweight or obesity (defined as a body mass index >= 25 and >= 30, respectively) and no symptoms of diabetes. Evidence AssessmentThe USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and offering or referring patients with prediabetes to effective preventive interventions has a moderate net benefit. Conclusions and RecommendationThe USPSTF recommends screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults aged 35 to 70 years who have overweight or obesity. Clinicians should offer or refer patients with prediabetes to effective preventive interventions. (B recommendation) This 2021 Recommendation Statement from the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults aged 35 to 70 years who have overweight or obesity and that clinicians should offer or refer patients with prediabetes to effective preventive interventions (B recommendation).","[Davidson, Karina W.] Feinstein Inst Med Res, Northwell Hlth, Manhasset, NY 11030 USA; [Barry, Michael J.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Mangione, Carol M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Cabana, Michael] Albert Einstein Coll Med, New York, NY USA; [Caughey, Aaron B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, Dorset, England; [Davis, Esa M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Donahue, Katrina E.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Doubeni, Chyke A.] Mayo Clin, Rochester, MN USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Fairfax Family Practice Residency, Fairfax, VA USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, CA USA; [Kubik, Martha] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Li, Li] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Ogedegbe, Gbenga] NYU, New York, NY USA; [Owens, Douglas K.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pbert, Lori] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Silverstein, Michael] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Stevermer, James] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Hlth Res & Educ Inst, Honolulu, HI USA; [Wong, John B.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02111 USA",,"Davidson, KW (corresponding author), Feinstein Inst Med Res, Northwell Hlth, Manhasset, NY 11030 USA.",chair@uspstf.net,,,,,,,49,35,36,4,10,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

OBJECTIVE To synthesize evidence on the effects of screening, testing, and treatment for elevated blood lead level in pregnant women and children aged 5 years and younger in the primary care setting to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force. DATA SOURCES Cochrane CENTRAL and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through June 2018) and Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to June 2018); surveillance through December 5, 2018. STUDY SELECTION English-language trials and observational studies of screening for and treating elevated lead levels in asymptomatic children and pregnant women. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Independent critical appraisal and data abstraction by 2 reviewers using predefined criteria. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Elevated blood lead level, morbidity, mortality, clinical prediction tools, test accuracy, adverse events. RESULTS A total of 24 studies (N = 11 433) were included in this review. No studies evaluated the benefits or harms of screening vs no screening in children. More than 1 positive answer on the 5-item 1991 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) screening questionnaire was associated with a pooled sensitivity of 48%(95% CI, 31.4% to 65.6%) and specificity of 58%(95% CI, 39.9% to 74.0%) for identifying children with a venous blood lead level greater than 10 mu g/dL (5 studies [n = 2265]). Adapted versions of the CDC questionnaire did not demonstrate improved accuracy. Capillary blood lead testing demonstrated sensitivity of 87% to 91% and specificity greater than 90%, compared with venous measurement (4 studies [n = 1431]). Counseling and nutritional interventions or residential lead hazard control techniques did not reduce blood lead concentrations in asymptomatic children, but studies were few and had methodological limitations (7 studies [n = 1419]). One trial (n = 780) of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) chelation therapy found reduced blood lead levels in children at 1 week to 1 year but not at 4.5 to 6 years, while another trial (n = 39) found no effect at 1 and 6 months. Seven-year follow-up assessments showed no effect on neuropsychological development, a small deficit in linear growth (height difference, 1.17 cm [95% CI, 0.41 to 1.93]), and poorer cognitive outcomes reported as the Attention and Executive Functions subscore of the Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment (unadjusted difference, -1.8 [95% CI, -4.5 to 1.0]; adjusted P = .045) in children treated with DMSA chelation. Evidence was too limited to determine the accuracy of screening questionnaires or benefits and harms of treatment in pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Screening questionnaires were not accurate for identifying children with elevated blood lead levels. Chelating agents in children were not significantly associated with sustained effects on blood level levels but were associated with harms.","[Cantor, Amy G.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Pacific Northwest Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Dept Med Informat & Clin Epidemiol, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd,Mail Code BICC, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Cantor, Amy G.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Pacific Northwest Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Dept Family Med, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Cantor, Amy G.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Pacific Northwest Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Hendrickson, Rob] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Emergency Med, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Blazina, Ian; Griffin, Jessica; Grusing, Sara; McDonagh, Marian S.] Pacific Northwest Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Portland, OR USA",,"Cantor, AG (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Pacific Northwest Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Dept Med Informat & Clin Epidemiol, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd,Mail Code BICC, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",cantor@ohsu.edu,,"Cantor, Amy/0000-0002-4467-8484","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA290201500009I, 7]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This studywas funded under contract HHSA290201500009I, Task Order No. 7, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the USPSTF.",,49,11,11,2,10,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

OBJECTIVE To systematically review evidence for the US Preventive Services Task Force on the benefits and harms of 3 nontraditional risk factors in cardiovascular risk assessment: the ankle-brachial index (ABI), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level, and coronary artery calcium (CAC) score. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies published through May 22, 2017. Surveillance continued through February 7, 2018. STUDY SELECTION Studies of asymptomatic adults with no known cardiovascular disease. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Independent critical appraisal and data abstraction by 2 reviewers. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cardiovascular events, mortality, risk assessment performance measures (calibration, discrimination, or risk reclassification), and serious adverse events. RESULTS Forty-three studies (N = 267 244) were included. No adequately powered trials have evaluated the clinical effect of risk assessment with nontraditional risk factors on patient health outcomes. The addition of the ABI (10 studies), hsCRP level (25 studies), or CAC score (19 studies) can improve both discrimination and reclassification; the magnitude and consistency of improvement varies by nontraditional risk factor. For the ABI, improvements in performance were the greatest for women, in whom traditional risk assessment has poor discrimination (C statistic change of 0.112 and net reclassification index [NRI] of 0.096). Results were inconsistent for hsCRP level, with the largest analysis (n = 166 596) showing a minimal effect on risk prediction (C statistic change of 0.0039, NRI of 0.0152). The largest improvements in discrimination (C statistic change ranging from 0.018 to 0.144) and reclassification (NRI ranging from 0.084 to 0.35) were seen for CAC score, although CAC score may inappropriately reclassify individuals not having cardiovascular events into higher-risk categories, as determined by negative nonevent NRI. Evidence for the harms of nontraditional risk factor assessment was limited to computed tomography imaging for CAC scoring (8 studies) and showed that radiation exposure is low but may result in additional testing. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE There are insufficient adequately powered clinical trials evaluating the incremental effect of the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score in risk assessment and initiation of preventive therapy. Furthermore, the clinical meaning of improvements in measures of calibration, discrimination, and reclassification risk prediction studies is uncertain.","[Lin, Jennifer S.; Evans, Corinne V.; Johnson, Eric; Redmond, Nadia; Coppola, Erin L.; Smith, Ning] Kaiser Permanente, Kaiser Permanente Res Affiliates Evidence Based P, Ctr Hlth Res, Northwest,3800 N Interstate Ave, Portland, OR 97227 USA",,"Lin, JS (corresponding author), Kaiser Permanente, Kaiser Permanente Res Affiliates Evidence Based P, Ctr Hlth Res, Northwest,3800 N Interstate Ave, Portland, OR 97227 USA.",jennifer.s.lin@kpchr.org,,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA290201500007I]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA290201500007I, Task Order 2, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the USPSTF.",,95,82,82,1,10,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

OBJECTIVE To update the 2014 review on dental caries screening and preventive interventions to inform the USPSTF. DATA SOURCES Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (to September 2020); surveillance through July 23, 2021. STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on screening, preventive interventions, referral to dental care; cohort studies on screening and referral; studies on diagnostic accuracy of primary care oral examination or risk assessment; and a systematic review on risk of fluorosis included in prior USPSTF reviews. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS One investigator abstracted data; a second checked accuracy. Two investigators independently rated study quality. RESULTS Thirty-two studies (19 trials, 9 observational studies, and 4 nonrandomized clinical intervention studies [total 106 694 participants] and 1 systematic review [19 studies]) were included. No study evaluated effects of primary care screening on clinical outcomes. One study (n = 258) found primary care pediatrician examination associated with a sensitivity of 0.76 (95% CI. 0.55 to 0.91) and specificity of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.92 to 0.98) for identifying a child with cavities, and 1 study found a risk assessment tool associated with sensitivity of 0.53 and specificity of 0.77 (n = 697, CIs not reported) for a child with future caries. No new trials of dietary fluoride supplementation were identified. For prevention, topical fluoride compared with placebo or no topical fluoride was associated with decreased caries burden (13 trials, n = 5733; mean caries increment [difference in decayed, missing, and filled teeth or surfaces], -0,94 [95% CI, -1,74 to -0,34]) and likelihood of incident caries (12 trials, n = 8177; RR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.66 to 0.95]; absolute risk difference, -7%) in higher-risk populations or settings, with no increased fluorosis risk. Evidence on other preventive interventions was limited (education, xylitol) or unavailable (silver diamine fluoride), and no study directly evaluated primary care dentistry referral vs no referral. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE There was no direct evidence on benefits and harms of primary care oral health screening or referral to dentist. Dietary fluoride supplementation and fluoride varnish were associated with improved caries outcomes in higher-risk children and settings.","[Chou, Roger; Pappas, Miranda; Dana, Tracy; Selph, Shelley; Hart, Erica; Fu, Rongwei F.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Pacific Northwest Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Dept Med Informat & Clin Epidemiol, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Chou, Roger] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Div Gen Internal Med & Geriatr, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Fu, Rongwei F.; Schwarz, Eli] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Portland State Univ, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Schwarz, Eli] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Sch Dent, Portland, OR 97239 USA",,"Chou, R (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Pacific Northwest Evidence Based Practice Ctr, 3181 Sw Sam Jackson Pk Rd,Mail Code BICC, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",chour@ohsu.edu,,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA290201500009i, HHSA29032014T]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA290201500009i, PRISM order HHSA29032014T, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the US Preventive Services Task Force.",,58,5,5,3,4,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

As 2021 marks 100 years since the discovery of insulin, we revisit progress, global burden of type 1 diabetes trends, and understanding of the pathogenesis and management practices related to the disease. Despite much progress, inequities in access and availability of insulin formulations persist and are reflected in differences in survival and morbidity patterns related to the disease. Some of these inequities have also been exacerbated by health-system challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a clear opportunity to improve access to insulin and related essential technologies for improved management of type 1 diabetes in LMICs, especially as a part of universal health coverage. These improvements will require concerted action and investments in human resources, community engagement, and education for the timely diagnosis and management of type 1 diabetes, as well as adequate health-care financing. Further research in LMICs, especially those in Africa, is needed to improve our understanding of the burden, risk factors, and implementation strategies for managing type 1 diabetes.","[Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.; Lewis-Watts, Laura; Narang, Tanya] Hosp Sick Children SickKids, Ctr Global Child Hlth, Toronto, ON M5G 0A4, Canada; [Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.] Aga Khan Univ, Ctr Excellence Women & Child Hlth, Karachi 74800, Pakistan; [Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.] Aga Khan Univ, Inst Global Hlth & Dev, Karachi 74800, Pakistan; [Salam, Rehana A.] Mother & Child Care Trust, Karachi, Pakistan; [Gomber, Apoorva] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth & Populat, Boston, MA USA; [Mbanya, Jean Claude] Univ Yaounde I, Fac Med & Biomed Sci, Dept Internal Med & Specialties, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Alleyne, George] World Hlth Org, Pan Amer Hlth Org & Reg Off, Washington, DC USA",,"Bhutta, ZA (corresponding author), Hosp Sick Children SickKids, Ctr Global Child Hlth, Toronto, ON M5G 0A4, Canada.;Bhutta, ZA (corresponding author), Aga Khan Univ, Ctr Excellence Women & Child Hlth, Karachi 74800, Pakistan.;Bhutta, ZA (corresponding author), Aga Khan Univ, Inst Global Hlth & Dev, Karachi 74800, Pakistan.",zulfiqar.bhutta@sickkids.ca,,,Centre for Global Child Health at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto,Centre for Global Child Health at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto,This work was supported by the Centre for Global Child Health at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.

Importance Data on the use of antiretroviral drugs, including new drugs and formulations, for the treatment and prevention of HIV infection continue to guide optimal practices. Objective To evaluate new data and incorporate them into current recommendations for initiating HIV therapy, monitoring individuals starting on therapy, changing regimens, preventing HIV infection for those at risk, and special considerations for older people with HIV. Evidence Review New evidence was collected since the previous International Antiviral (formerly AIDS) Society-USA recommendations in 2018, including data published or presented at peer-reviewed scientific conferences through August 22, 2020. A volunteer panel of 15 experts in HIV research and patient care considered these data and updated previous recommendations. Findings From 5316 citations about antiretroviral drugs identified, 549 were included to form the evidence basis for these recommendations. Antiretroviral therapy is recommended as soon as possible for all individuals with HIV who have detectable viremia. Most patients can start with a 3-drug regimen or now a 2-drug regimen, which includes an integrase strand transfer inhibitor. Effective options are available for patients who may be pregnant, those who have specific clinical conditions, such as kidney, liver, or cardiovascular disease, those who have opportunistic diseases, or those who have health care access issues. Recommended for the first time, a long-acting antiretroviral regimen injected once every 4 weeks for treatment or every 8 weeks pending approval by regulatory bodies and availability. For individuals at risk for HIV, preexposure prophylaxis with an oral regimen is recommended or, pending approval by regulatory bodies and availability, with a long-acting injection given every 8 weeks. Monitoring before and during therapy for effectiveness and safety is recommended. Switching therapy for virological failure is relatively rare at this time, and the recommendations for switching therapies for convenience and for other reasons are included. With the survival benefits provided by therapy, recommendations are made for older individuals with HIV. The current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic poses particular challenges for HIV research, care, and efforts to end the HIV epidemic. Conclusion and Relevance Advances in HIV prevention and management with antiretroviral drugs continue to improve clinical care and outcomes among individuals at risk for and with HIV.","[Saag, Michael S.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL USA; [Gandhi, Rajesh T.; Sax, Paul E.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gandhi, Rajesh T.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Hoy, Jennifer F.] Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Hoy, Jennifer F.] Alfred Hosp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Landovitz, Raphael J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Thompson, Melanie A.] AIDS Res Consortium Atlanta, Atlanta, GA USA; [Sax, Paul E.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Smith, Davey M.; Benson, Constance A.] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Buchbinder, Susan P.] San Francisco Dept Publ Hlth, San Francisco, CA USA; [Buchbinder, Susan P.; Volberding, Paul A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [del Rio, Carlos] Emory Univ, Sch Med, Atlanta, GA USA; [Eron, Joseph J., Jr.] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Faetkenheuer, Gerd] Univ Hosp Cologne, Cologne, Germany; [Guenthard, Huldrych F.] Univ Hosp Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Guenthard, Huldrych F.] Univ Zurich, Inst Med Virol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Molina, Jean-Michel] Univ Paris, Paris, France; [Molina, Jean-Michel] St Louis Lariboisiere Hosp, APHP, Paris, France; [Jacobsen, Donna M.] Int Antiviral Soc USA, San Francisco, CA USA",,"Saag, MS (corresponding author), Univ Alabama Birmingham, Sch Med, 845 19th St S,BBRB 256, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.",msaag@uabmc.edu,"del Rio, Carlos/B-3763-2012; gunthard, huldrych f/F-1724-2011","del Rio, Carlos/0000-0002-0153-3517; gunthard, huldrych f/0000-0002-1142-6723",International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA),International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA),"The work is sponsored and funded by the International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA).

Findings This mixed-methods study identified 5 practices that may enhance physician presence and meaningful connection with patients in the clinical encounter: (1) prepare with intention; (2) listen intently and completely; (3) agree on what matters most; (4) connect with the patient's story; and (5) explore emotional cues. Meaning For busy clinicians with multiple demands and distractions, 5 recommended practices have the potential to facilitate meaningful interactions with patients. This study uses systematic reviews, interviews, and an expert consensus process to identify practices that promote clinician presence and connection during patient visits: preparation and listening with intent, agreeing on what matters most, connecting with the patient's story, and exploring emotional cues. Importance Time constraints, technology, and administrative demands of modern medicine often impede the human connection that is central to clinical care, contributing to physician and patient dissatisfaction. Objective To identify evidence and narrative-based practices that promote clinician presence, a state of awareness, focus, and attention with the intent to understand patients. Evidence Review Preliminary practices were derived through a systematic literature review (from January 1997 to August 2017, with a subsequent bridge search to September 2019) of effective interpersonal interventions; observations of primary care encounters in 3 diverse clinics (n = 27 encounters); and qualitative interviews with physicians (n = 10), patients (n = 27), and nonmedical professionals whose occupations involve intense interpersonal interactions (eg, firefighter, chaplain, social worker; n = 30). After evidence synthesis, promising practices were reviewed in a 3-round modified Delphi process by a panel of 14 researchers, clinicians, patients, caregivers, and health system leaders. Panelists rated each practice using 9-point Likert scales (-4 to +4) that reflected the potential effect on patient and clinician experience and feasibility of implementation; after the third round, panelists selected their top 5 practices from among those with median ratings of at least +2 for all 3 criteria. Final recommendations incorporate elements from all highly rated practices and emphasize the practices with the greatest number of panelist votes. Findings The systematic literature review (n = 73 studies) and qualitative research activities yielded 31 preliminary practices. Following evidence synthesis, 13 distinct practices were reviewed by the Delphi panel, 8 of which met criteria for inclusion and were combined into a final set of 5 recommendations: (1) prepare with intention (take a moment to prepare and focus before greeting a patient); (2) listen intently and completely (sit down, lean forward, avoid interruptions); (3) agree on what matters most (find out what the patient cares about and incorporate these priorities into the visit agenda); (4) connect with the patient's story (consider life circumstances that influence the patient's health; acknowledge positive efforts; celebrate successes); and (5) explore emotional cues (notice, name, and validate the patient's emotions). Conclusions and Relevance This mixed-methods study identified 5 practices that have the potential to enhance physician presence and meaningful connection with patients in the clinical encounter. Evaluation and validation of the outcomes associated with implementing the 5 practices is needed, along with system-level interventions to create a supportive environment for implementation.","[Zulman, Donna M.; Shaw, Jonathan G.; Brown-Johnson, Cati G.; Tierney, Aaron A.; Zionts, Dani L.; Safaeinili, Nadia; Fischer, Meredith; Asch, Steven M.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Div Primary Care & Populat Hlth, Med Sch Off Bldg,1265 Welch Rd,MC 5411, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Zulman, Donna M.; Haverfield, Marie C.; Schwartz, Rachel; Tierney, Aaron A.; Asch, Steven M.] VA Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst Ctr Innovat Implement, Menlo Pk, CA USA; [Haverfield, Marie C.; Schwartz, Rachel] Stanford Univ, Ctr Primary Care & Outcomes Res PCOR, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Haverfield, Marie C.; Schwartz, Rachel] Ctr Hlth Res & Policy, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Israni, Sonoo Thadaney; Verghese, Abraham] Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,"Zulman, DM (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Div Primary Care & Populat Hlth, Med Sch Off Bldg,1265 Welch Rd,MC 5411, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",dzulman@stanford.edu,", Marie/ABF-3036-2020",", Marie/0000-0003-2949-0229; Safaeinili, Nadia/0000-0003-4792-3091; Brown-Johnson, Cati/0000-0002-5415-3665",Gordon & Betty Moore Foundation [6382]; VA Office of Academic Affairs Advanced Fellowship,Gordon & Betty Moore Foundation(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation); VA Office of Academic Affairs Advanced Fellowship,"This study was supported by grant 6382 from the Gordon & Betty Moore Foundation (to Drs Zulman and Verghese, principal investigators) and by a VA Office of Academic Affairs Advanced Fellowship (to Drs Haverfield and Schwartz).",,90,90,89,11,29,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

The odds ratio for risk of developing disease with a positive FHH is frequently greater than 2, and actions can be taken to mitigate risk by adhering to screening guidelines, genetic counselling, genetic risk testing, and other screening methods. Challenges to the routine acquisition of FHH include constraints on provider time to collect data and the difficulty in accessing risk calculators. Disease-specific and broader risk assessment software platforms have been developed, many with clinical decision support and informatics interoperability, but few access patient information directly. Software that allows integration of FHH with the electronic medical record and clinical decision support capabilities has provided solutions to many of these challenges. Patient facing, electronic medical record, and web-enabled FHH platforms have been developed, and can provide greater identification of risk compared with conventional FHH ascertainment in primary care. FHH, along with cascade screening, can be an important component of population health management approaches to overall reduction of risk.","[Ginsburg, Geoffrey S.; Wu, R.

ImportanceAcute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States with an annual incidence of approximately 1 million. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), consisting of aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel) reduces cardiovascular event rates after ACS. ObservationsIn 2016, the updated guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) recommended aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for at least 12 months for patients with ACS. Since these recommendations were published, new randomized clinical trials have studied different regimens and durations of antiplatelet therapy. Recommendations vary according to the risk of bleeding. If bleeding risk is low, prolonged DAPT may be considered, although the optimal duration of prolonged DAPT beyond 1 year is not well established. If bleeding risk is high, shorter duration (ie, 3-6 months) of DAPT may be reasonable. A high risk of bleeding traditionally is defined as a 1-year risk of serious bleeding (either fatal or associated with a >= 3-g/dL drop in hemoglobin) of at least 4% or a risk of an intracranial hemorrhage of at least 1%. Patients at higher risk are 65 years old or older; have low body weight (BMI <18.5), diabetes, or prior bleeding; or take oral anticoagulants. The newest P2Y12 inhibitors, prasugrel and ticagrelor, are more potent, with high on-treatment residual platelet reactivity of about 3% vs 30% to 40% with clopidogrel and act within 30 minutes compared with 2 hours for clopidogrel. Clinicians should avoid prescribing prasugrel to patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack because of an increased risk of cerebrovascular events (6.5% vs 1.2% with clopidogrel, P=.002) and should avoid prescribing it to patients older than 75 years or who weigh less than 60 kg. The ISAR-REACT-5 trial found that prasugrel reduced rates of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke at 1 year compared with ticagrelor among patients with ACS undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (9.3% vs 6.9%, P=.006) with no significant difference in bleeding. Recent trials suggested that discontinuing aspirin rather than the P2Y12 inhibitor may be associated with better outcomes. Conclusions and RelevanceDual antiplatelet therapy reduces rates of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Specific combinations and duration of dual antiplatelet therapy should be based on patient characteristics-risk of bleeding myocardial ischemia.","[Kamran, Hassan; Jneid, Hani; Kayani, Waleed T.; Virani, Salim S.; Levine, Glenn N.; Nambi, Vijay; Khalid, Umair] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Med, Sect Cardiol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Jneid, Hani; Virani, Salim S.; Levine, Glenn N.; Nambi, Vijay; Khalid, Umair] Michael E DeBakey VA Med Ctr, Dept Med, Sect Cardiol, Houston, TX USA",,"Khalid, U (corresponding author), Michael E DeBakey VA Med Ctr, 2002 Holcombe Blvd Mail Code 111B, Houston, TX 77030 USA.;Khalid, U (corresponding author), Baylor Coll Med, 2002 Holcombe Blvd Mail Code 111B, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",mukhalid@bcm.edu,,,,,,,65,11,11,4,14,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Numerous randomized trials have required changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but guidance for reporting such modifications is incomplete. OBJECTIVE As a joint extension for the CONSORT and SPIRIT reporting guidelines, CONSERVE (CONSORT and SPIRIT Extension for RCTs Revised in Extenuating Circumstances) aims to improve reporting of trial protocols and completed trials that undergo important modifications in response to extenuating circumstances. EVIDENCE A panel of 37 international trial investigators, patient representatives, methodologists and statisticians, ethicists, funders, regulators, and journal editors convened to develop the guideline. The panel developed CONSERVE following an accelerated, iterative process between June 2020 and February 2021 involving (1) a rapid literature review of multiple databases (OVID Medline, OVID EMBASE, and EBSCO CINAHL) and gray literature sources from 2003 to March 2021; (2) consensus-based panelist meetings using a modified Delphi process and surveys; and (3) a global survey of trial stakeholders. FINDINGS The rapid review yielded 41 673 citations, of which 38 titles were relevant, including emerging guidance from regulatory and funding agencies for managing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on trials. However, no generalizable guidance for all circumstances in which trials and trial protocols might face unanticipated modifications were identified. The CONSERVE panel used these findings to develop a consensus reporting guidelines following 4 rounds of meetings and surveys. Responses were received from 198 professionals from 34 countries, of whom 90% (n = 178) indicated that they understood the concept definitions and 85.4% (n = 169) indicated that they understood and could use the implementation tool. Feedback from survey respondents was used to finalize the guideline and confirm that the guideline's core concepts were applicable and had utility for the trial community. CONSERVE incorporates an implementation tool and checklists tailored to trial reports and trial protocols for which extenuating circumstances have resulted in important modifications to the intended study procedures. The checklists include 4 sections capturing extenuating circumstances, important modifications, responsible parties, and interim data analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE CONSERVE offers an extension to CONSORT and SPIRIT that could improve the transparency, quality, and completeness of reporting important modifications to trials in extenuating circumstances such as COVID-19.","[Orkin, Aaron M.] Univ Toronto, Dept Family & Community Med, Div Emergency Med, 500 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1V7, Canada; [Orkin, Aaron M.] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Gill, Peter J.] Univ Toronto, Hosp Sick Children, Dept Paediat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Ghersi, Davina] Natl Hlth & Med Res Council, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Campbell, Lisa] Med & Healthcare Prod Regulatory Agcy, Clin Trials Unit, London, England; [Sugarman, Jeremy] Johns Hopkins Univ, Berman Inst Bioeth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Emsley, Richard] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, Dept Biostat & Hlth Informat, London, England; [Steg, Philippe Gabriel] Univ Paris, AP HP, Paris, France; [Weijer, Charles] Western Univ, Dept Med, London, ON, Canada; [Weijer, Charles] Western Univ, Dept Epidemiol, London, ON, Canada; [Weijer, Charles] Western Univ, Dept Biostat, London, ON, Canada; [Simes, John] Univ Sydney, Natl Hlth & Med Res Council, Clin Trials Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Rombey, Tanja] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Hlth Care Management, Berlin, Germany; [Williams, Hywel C.] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham, England; [Williams, Hywel C.] Natl Inst Hlth Res, Nottingham, England; [Wittes, Janet] WCG Stat Collaborat, Washington, DC USA; [Moher, David] Univ Ottawa, Sch Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Ctr Journalol, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Richards, Dawn P.] Clin Trials Ontario, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Kasamon, Yvette] US FDA, Ctr Drug Evaluat & Res, Off Oncol Dis, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Getz, Kenneth] Tufts Ctr Study Drug Dev, Boston, MA USA; [Hopewell, Sally] Univ Oxford, Ctr Stat Med, Oxford Clin Trials Res Unit, Oxford, England; [Dickersin, Kay] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Wu, Taixiang] Sichuan Univ, Chinese Clin Trial Registry, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Ayala, Ana Patricia] Univ Toronto, Gerstein Sci Informat Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Schulz, Kenneth F.] FHI 360, Durham, NC USA; [Schulz, Kenneth F.] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Calleja, Sabine] Univ Toronto, Gerstein Sci Informat Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Boutron, Isabelle] Univ Paris, Ctr Res Epidemiol & Stat, INSERM, Paris, France; [Ross, Joseph S.] Yale Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, New Haven, CT USA; [Ross, Joseph S.] BMJ, London, England; [Golub, Robert M.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Med, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Khan, Karim M.] Inst Musculoskeletal Hlth & Arthrit, Canadian Inst Hlth Res, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Mulrow, Cindy] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA; [Siegfried, Nandi] South African Med Res Council, Other Drugs Res Unit, Cape Town, South Africa; [Heber, Joerg] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA USA; [Lee, Naomi] Lancet, London, England; [Kearney, Pamela Reed] Natl Inst Hlth, Div Human Subjects Res, Off Extramural Res, Bethesda, MD USA; [Wanyenze, Rhoda K.] Makerere Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Dis Control & Environm Hlth, Kampala, Uganda; [Wanyenze, Rhoda K.] Makerere Univ, Kampala, Uganda; [Hrobjartsson, Asbjorn] Univ Southern Denmark, Ctr Evidence Based Med Odense CEBMO, Odense, Denmark; [Hrobjartsson, Asbjorn] Univ Southern Denmark, Cochrane Denmark, Odense, Denmark; [Williams, Rebecca] NLB, Clin Trials Gov, NIH, Bethesda, MD USA; [Bhandari, Nita] Ctr Hlth Res & Dev, Soc Appl Studies, New Delhi, India; [Juni, Peter] Univ Toronto, St Michaels Hosp, Appl Hlth Res Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Chan, An-Wen] Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Womens Coll Res Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada",,"Orkin, AM (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Family & Community Med, Div Emergency Med, 500 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1V7, Canada.",aaron.orkin@utoronto.ca,"Ayala, Ana Patricia/P-8955-2015; Emsley, Richard/N-1342-2016; Weijer, Charles/ABC-5433-2020; Juni, Peter/Q-8700-2016; Orkin, Aaron/K-2500-2014","Ayala, Ana Patricia/0000-0002-3613-2270; Emsley, Richard/0000-0002-1218-675X; Weijer, Charles/0000-0002-5510-1074; Juni, Peter/0000-0002-5985-0670; Orkin, Aaron/0000-0002-1111-8720; Calleja, Sabine/0000-0001-5297-0736","CIHR Postdoctoral Fellowship Program; National Institute of Health Research [NIHR300051]; Intramural Research Program of the National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health","CIHR Postdoctoral Fellowship Program(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); National Institute of Health Research(National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)); Intramural Research Program of the National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health","Dr Orkin receives salary support from the University of Toronto Department of Family and Community Medicine and the CIHR Postdoctoral Fellowship Program.

Deliberate policies increased domestic training capacities for all cadres of health personnel and distributed them to rural and underserved areas. Since 1975, targeted insurance schemes for different population groups have improved financial access to health care until universal health coverage was implemented in 2002. Despite its low gross national income per capita in Thailand, a bold decision was made to use general taxation to finance the Universal Health Coverage Scheme without relying on contributions from members. Empirical evidence shows substantial reduction in levels of out-of-pocket payments, the incidence of catastrophic health spending, and in medical impoverishment. The scheme has also greatly reduced provincial gaps in child mortality. Certain interventions such as antiretroviral therapy and renal replacement therapy have saved the lives of adults. Well designed strategic purchasing contributed to efficiency, cost containment, and equity. Remaining challenges include preparing for an ageing society, primary prevention of non-communicable diseases, law enforcement to prevent road traffic mortality, and effective coverage of diabetes and tuberculosis control.","[Tangcharoensathien, Viroj; Witthayapipopsakul, Woranan; Panichkriangkrai, Warisa; Patcharanarumol, Walaiporn] Minist Publ Hlth, Int Hlth Policy Program, Nonthaburi 11000, Thailand; [Mills, Anne] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London, England",,"Tangcharoensathien, V (corresponding author), Minist Publ Hlth, Int Hlth Policy Program, Nonthaburi 11000, Thailand.",viroj@ihpp.thaigov.net,"Supprasert, Warunsicha/F-4602-2017; Witthayapipopsakul, Woranan/Q-8942-2019","Witthayapipopsakul, Woranan/0000-0003-1817-8264",,,,,113,107,107,3,47,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,MAR 24,2018,391,10126,,,,,1205,1223,,10.1016/S0140-6736(18)30198-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)30198-3,,,19,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),General & Internal Medicine,GA2MF,29397200,Green Submitted,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000428156100032,View Full Record in Web of Science,82575,0,12,38,47,92,97,52,35,86,94,24,58,61,6,81,109

However, many antibiotic reactions documented as allergies were unknown or not remembered by the patient, cutaneous reactions unrelated to drug hypersensitivity, drug-infection interactions, or drug intolerances. Although such reactions pose negligible risk to patients, they currently represent a global threat to public health. Antibiotic allergy labels result in displacement of first-line therapies for antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment. A penicillin allergy label, in particular, is associated with increased use of broad-spectrum and non-beta-lactam antibiotics, which results in increased adverse events and antibiotic resistance. Most patients labelled as allergic to penicillins are not allergic when appropriately stratified for risk, tested, and re-challenged.

One randomized clinical trial (RCT) (n = 12 483) comparing screening with no screening reported fewer hip fractures (2.6% vs 3.5%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.72 [95% CI, 0.59-0.89]) but no other statistically significant benefits or harms. The accuracy of bone measurement tests to identify osteoporosis varied (area under the curve [AUC], 0.32-0.89). The pooled accuracy of clinical risk assessments for identifying osteoporosis ranged from AUC of 0.65 to 0.76 in women and from 0.76 to 0.80 in men; the accuracy for predicting fractures was similar. For women, bisphosphonates, parathyroid hormone, raloxifene, and denosumab were associated with a lower risk of vertebral fractures (9 trials [n = 23 690]; relative risks [RRs] from 0.32-0.64). Bisphosphonates (8 RCTs [n = 16 438]; pooled RR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.76-0.92]) and denosumab (1 RCT [n = 7868]; RR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.67-0.95]) were associated with a lower risk of nonvertebral fractures. Denosumab reduced the risk of hip fracture (1 RCT [n = 7868]; RR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.37-0.97]), but bisphosphonates did not have a statistically significant association (3 RCTs [n = 8988]; pooled RR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.44-1.11]). Evidence was limited for men: zoledronic acid reduced the risk of radiographic vertebral fractures (1 RCT [n = 1199]; RR, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.16-0.70]); no studies demonstrated reductions in clinical or hip fractures. Bisphosphonates were not consistently associated with reported harms other than deep vein thrombosis (raloxifene vs placebo; 3 RCTs [n = 5839]; RR, 2.14 [95% CI, 0.99-4.66]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In women, screening to prevent osteoporotic fractures may reduce hip fractures, and treatment reduced the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures; there was not consistent evidence of treatment harms. The accuracy of bone measurement tests or clinical risk assessments for identifying osteoporosis or predicting fractures varied from very poor to good.","[Viswanathan, Meera; Reddy, Shivani; Berkman, Nancy; Cullen, Katie; Kahwati, Leila C.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, RTI Int, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Viswanathan, Meera; Reddy, Shivani; Berkman, Nancy; Cullen, Katie; Middleton, Jennifer Cook; Kahwati, Leila C.] RTI Int, 3040 E Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Middleton, Jennifer Cook] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Cecil G Sheps Ctr Hlth Serv Res, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Nicholson, Wanda K.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Chapel Hill, NC USA",,"Viswanathan, M (corresponding author), RTI Int, 3040 E Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",viswanathan@rti.org,,"Berkman, Nancy/0000-0003-3617-1082; Kahwati, Leila/0000-0001-6963-2848; Reddy, Shivani/0000-0003-2803-6155","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA-290-2012-000151, 6]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA-290-2012-000151, Task Order 6, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the USPSTF.",,123,78,85,0,13,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Hypertension is a major contributing risk factor for heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, and chronic kidney disease. ObjectiveTo reaffirm its 2015 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for hypertension in adults, the accuracy of office blood pressure measurement for initial screening, and the accuracy of various confirmatory blood pressure measurement methods. PopulationAdults 18 years or older without known hypertension. Evidence AssessmentUsing a reaffirmation deliberation process, the USPSTF concludes with high certainty that screening for hypertension in adults has substantial net benefit. RecommendationThe USPSTF recommends screening for hypertension in adults 18 years or older with office blood pressure measurement. The USPSTF recommends obtaining blood pressure measurements outside of the clinical setting for diagnostic confirmation before starting treatment. (A recommendation) This 2021 US Preventive Services Task Force Reaffirmation Recommendation Statement recommends screening for hypertension in adults 18 years or older with office blood pressure measurement and obtaining blood pressure measurements outside of the clinical setting for diagnostic confirmation before starting treatment (A recommendation).","[Krist, Alex H.] Fairfax Family Practice Residency, Fairfax, VA USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, One Capitol Sq,830 E Main St,Sixth Floor, Richmond, VA 23219 USA; [Davidson, Karina W.] Northwell Hlth, Feinstein Inst Med Res, Manhasset, NY USA; [Mangione, Carol M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Cabana, Michael] Albert Einstein Coll Med, New York, NY USA; [Caughey, Aaron B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Davis, Esa M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Donahue, Katrina E.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Doubeni, Chyke A.] Mayo Clin, Rochester, MN USA; [Kubik, Martha] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Li, Li] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Ogedegbe, Gbenga] NYU, New York, NY USA; [Pbert, Lori] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Worcester, MA USA; [Silverstein, Michael] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Stevermer, James] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Univ Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Pacific Hlth Res & Educ Inst, Honolulu, HI USA; [Wong, John B.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02111 USA",,"Krist, AH (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, One Capitol Sq,830 E Main St,Sixth Floor, Richmond, VA 23219 USA.",chair@uspstf.net,,,,,,,40,27,27,4,5,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

OBJECTIVE To update the 2013 US Preventive Services Task Force review on benefits and harms of risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA1/2-related cancer in women. DATA SOURCES Cochrane libraries; MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE (January 1, 2013, to March 6, 2019, for updates; January 1, 1994, to March 6, 2019, for new key questions and populations); reference lists. STUDY SELECTION Discriminatory accuracy studies, randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and observational studies of women without recently diagnosed BRCA1/2-related cancer. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data on study methods, setting, population characteristics, eligibility criteria, interventions, numbers enrolled and lost to follow-up, outcome ascertainment, and results were abstracted. Two reviewers independently assessed study quality. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cancer incidence and mortality; discriminatory accuracy of risk assessment tools for BRCA1/2 mutations; benefits and harms of risk assessment, genetic counseling, genetic testing, and risk-reducing interventions. RESULTS For this review, 103 studies (110 articles; N = 92712) were included. No studies evaluated the effectiveness of risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing in reducing incidence and mortality of BRCA1/2-related cancer. Fourteen studies (n = 43813) of 8 risk assessment tools to guide referrals to genetic counseling demonstrated moderate to high accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.68-0.96). Twenty-eight studies (n = 8060) indicated that genetic counseling was associated with reduced breast cancer worry, anxiety, and depression; increased understanding of risk; and decreased intention for testing. Twenty studies (n = 4322) showed that breast cancer worry and anxiety were higher after testing for women with positive results and lower for others; understanding of risk was higher after testing. In 8 RCTs (n = 54651), tamoxifen (relative risk [RR], 0.69 [95% CI, 0.59-0.84]; 4 trials), raloxifene (RR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.24-0.80]; 2 trials), and aromatase inhibitors (RR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.26-0.70]; 2 trials) were associated with lower risks of invasive breast cancer compared with placebo; results were not specific to mutation carriers. Mastectomy was associated with 90% to 100% reduction in breast cancer incidence (6 studies; n = 2546) and 81% to 100% reduction in breast cancer mortality (1 study; n = 639); oophorectomy was associated with 69% to 100% reduction in ovarian cancer (2 studies; n = 2108); complications were common with mastectomy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among women without recently diagnosed BRCA1/2-related cancer, the benefits and harms of risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing to reduce cancer incidence and mortality have not been directly evaluated by current research.","[Nelson, Heidi D.; Pappas, Miranda; Cantor, Amy; Haney, Elizabeth; Holmes, Rebecca] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Pacific Northwest Evidence Based Practice Ctr, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd,Mail Code BICC, Portland, OR 97239 USA",,"Nelson, HD (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Pacific Northwest Evidence Based Practice Ctr, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd,Mail Code BICC, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",nelsonh@ohsu.edu,,"Cantor, Amy/0000-0002-4467-8484","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA290201500009I, 7]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA290201500009I, Task Order 7, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).",,162,67,67,1,7,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Acute HTRs occurring during or within 24 h after administration of a blood product are usually caused by transfusion of incompatible red blood cells (RBCs), and, more rarely, of a large volume of incompatible plasma. Delayed HTRs are caused by a secondary immune response to an antigen on the donor's RBCs. In some patients with delayed HTRs, an additional bystander hemolysis of the patient's RBCs can be assumed. Different mechanisms lead to intra- and extra vascular hemolysis, such as complete complement activation, phagocytosis of RBCs covered with C3b by macrophages after incomplete complement activation, or destruction of RBCs covered only with IgG by direct cell-cell contact with K cells. The clinical consequences of HTRs are triggered via several pathophysiological pathways like formation of anaphylatoxins, release of cytokines causing a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, activation of the kinin system, the intrinsic clotting cascade and fibrinolysis resulting in hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulation, diffuse bleeding, and disruption of microcirculation leading to renal failure and shock. In the following, the symptoms of HTR are introduced, laboratory investigations and treatment are described, and some recommendations for prevention are given.","[Panch, Sandhya R.; Montemayor-Garcia, Celina; Klein, Harvey G.] NIH, Dept Transfus Med, Warren G Magnuson Clin Ctr, Ctr Clin, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",,"Panch, SR (corresponding author), NIH, Ctr Cellular Engn, Dept Transfus Med, Warren G Magnuson Clin Ctr, Bldg 10,3C-720D, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",sandhya.panch@nih.gov,,,,,,,73,31,33,1,10,MASSACHUSETTS MEDICAL SOC,WALTHAM,"WALTHAM WOODS CENTER, 860 WINTER ST,, WALTHAM, MA 02451-1413 USA",0028-4793,1533-4406,,NEW ENGL J MED,N.

This Series paper provides a global overview of the prevalence, benefits, and promotion policies for physical activity for people living with disabilities (PLWD). PLWD are 16-62% less likely to meet physical activity guidelines and are at higher risk of serious health problems related to inactivity than people without disabilities. Meta-analyses have shown that physical activity has beneficial effects on cardiovascular fitness (average standardised mean difference [SMD] 0.69 [95% CI 0.31-1.01]), musculoskeletal fitness (0.59 [0.31-0.87]), cardiometabolic risk factors (0.39 [0.04-0.75]), and brain and mental health outcomes (0.47 [0.21-0.73]). These meta-analyses also show that health benefits can be achieved even with less than 150 min of physical activity per week, and suggest that some physical activity is better than none. Meta-analyses of interventions to increase physical activity for PLWD have reported effect sizes ranging from SMD 0.29 (95% CI 0.17-0.41, k=10) to 1.00 (0.46-1.53, k=10). There is increasing awareness among policy makers of the needs of PLWD for full participation in physical activity. Physical activity action plans worldwide must be adequately resourced, monitored, and enforced to truly advance the fundamental rights of PLWD to fully participate in physical activity.","[Ginis, Kathleen A.

Treatment to prevent CVD events by modifying risk factors is currently informed by the Framingham Risk Score, the Pooled Cohort Equations, or similar CVD risk assessment models. If current CVD risk assessment models could be improved by adding more risk factors, treatment might be better targeted, thereby maximizing the benefits and minimizing the harms. OBJECTIVE To update the 2009 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on using nontraditional risk factors in coronary heart disease risk assessment. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on using nontraditional risk factors in CVD risk assessment, focusing on the ankle-brachial index (ABI), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level, and coronary artery calcium (CAC) score; the health benefits and harms of CVD risk assessment and treatment guided by nontraditional risk factors combined with the Framingham Risk Score or Pooled Cohort Equations compared with using either risk assessment model alone; and whether adding nontraditional risk factors to existing CVD risk assessment models improves measures of calibration, discrimination, and risk reclassification. FINDINGS The USPSTF found adequate evidence that adding the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score to existing CVD risk assessment models results in small improvements in discrimination and risk reclassification; however, the clinical meaning of these changes is largely unknown. Evidence on adding the ABI, hsCRP level, and CAC score to the Pooled Cohort Equations is limited. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess whether treatment decisions guided by the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score, in addition to risk factors in existing CVD risk assessment models, leads to reduced incidence of CVD events or mortality. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to conceptually bound the harms of early detection and interventions as small. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of using the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score in risk assessment for CVD in asymptomatic adults to prevent CVD events. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of adding the ABI, hsCRP level, or CAC score to traditional risk assessment for CVD in asymptomatic adults to prevent CVD events.

Approximately 80% of individuals with dyspepsia have no structural explanation for their symptoms and have functional dyspepsia. Functional dyspepsia affects up to 16% of otherwise healthy individuals in the general population. Risk factors include psychological comorbidity, acute gastroenteritis, female sex, smoking, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and Helicobacter pylori infection. The pathophysiology remains incompletely understood, but it is probably related to disordered communication between the gut and the brain, leading to motility disturbances, visceral hypersensitivity, and alterations in gastrointestinal microbiota, mucosal and immune function, and CNS processing. Although technically a normal endoscopy is required to diagnose functional dyspepsia, the utility of endoscopy in all patients with typical symptoms is minimal; its use should be restricted to people aged 55 years and older, or to those with concerning features, such as weight loss or vomiting. As a result of our incomplete understanding of its pathophysiology, functional dyspepsia is difficult to treat and, in most patients, the condition is chronic and the natural history is one of fluctuating symptoms. Eradication therapy should be offered to patients with functional dyspepsia who test positive for Helicobacter pylori. Other therapies with evidence of effectiveness include proton pump inhibitors, histamine-2 receptor antagonists, prokinetics, and central neuromodulators.

Notably, the SDGs contain no mention of primary health care, reflecting the disappointing implementation of the Alma-Ata declaration of 1978 over the past four decades. The draft Astana declaration (Alma-Ata 2 . 0), released in June, 2018, restates the key principles of primary health care and renews these as driving forces for achieving the SDGs, emphasising universal health coverage. We use accumulating evidence to show that countries that reoriente their health systems towards primary care are better placed to achieve the SDGs than those with hospital-focused systems or low investment in health. We then argue that an even bolder approach, which fully embraces the Alma-Ata vision of primary health care, could deliver substantially greater SDG progress, by addressing the wider determinants of health, promoting equity and social justice throughout society, empowering communities, and being a catalyst for advancing and amplifying universal health coverage and synergies among SDGs.","[Hone, Thomas; Millett, Christopher] Imperial Coll London, Sch Publ Hlth, Publ Hlth Policy Evaluat Unit, London W2 1PG, England; [Macinko, James] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Macinko, James] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Millett, Christopher] Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Epidemiol Studies Hlth & Nutr, Sao Paulo, Brazil",,"Hone, T (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Sch Publ Hlth, Publ Hlth Policy Evaluat Unit, London W2 1PG, England.",thomas.hone12@imperial.ac.uk,,"Millett, Christopher/0000-0002-0793-9884; Hone, Thomas/0000-0003-0703-6973; Macinko, James/0000-0001-8055-5441",National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) [RP 2014-04-032]; Joint Health Systems Research Initiative; NIHR School of Public Health Research; MRC [MR/P014593/1] Funding Source: UKRI,National Institute of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)); Joint Health Systems Research Initiative; NIHR School of Public Health Research; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"CM is funded by a National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Research Professorship (RP 2014-04-032).

Micronutrient supplementation can reduce the risk of progression to advanced AMD. Treatment of neovascular AMD with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor pharmacotherapy reduces vision loss. Key Clinical Points Age-Related Macular Degeneration Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of vision loss in persons older than 60 years of age in industrialized nations, may be asymptomatic in early stages. A baseline examination by an eye care provider establishes the diagnosis of AMD and helps to determine the disease stage. Ancillary testing that includes optical coherence tomography is used in staging disease, guiding treatment, and assessing the response to therapy. Neovascular AMD is treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor pharmacotherapy. Treatment should be initiated soon after the diagnosis to prevent severe vision loss. Micronutrient supplementation, as tested in the Age-Related Eye Disease Studies, is recommended to reduce the risk of progression of intermediate-stage AMD to advanced AMD. Patients should be counseled regarding smoking cessation, blood-pressure control (if they have hypertension), and monitoring of their vision with an Amsler grid.","[Apte, Rajendra S.] Washington Univ Sch Med, Dev Biol & Med, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, 660 S Euclid Ave,Box 8096, St Louis, MO 63110 USA",,"Apte, RS (corresponding author), Washington Univ Sch Med, Dev Biol & Med, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, 660 S Euclid Ave,Box 8096, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",apte@wustl.edu,,"Apte, Rajendra/0000-0003-2281-2336",,,,,55,10,10,10,26,MASSACHUSETTS MEDICAL SOC,WALTHAM,"WALTHAM WOODS CENTER, 860 WINTER ST,, WALTHAM, MA 02451-1413 USA",0028-4793,1533-4406,,NEW ENGL J MED,N.

Methods We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised, placebo-controlled, cardiovascular outcome trials of SGLT2i in patients with type 2 diabetes. We searched PubMed and Embase for trials published up to Sept 24, 2018. Data search and extraction were completed with a standardised data form and any discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Efficacy outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death), the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure, and progression of renal disease. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were pooled across trials, and efficacy outcomes were stratified by baseline presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and degree of renal function. Findings We included data from three identified trials and 34 322 patients (60.2% with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease), with 3342 major adverse cardiovascular events, 2028 cardiovascular deaths or hospitalisation sfor heart failure events, and 766 renal composite outcomes. SGLT2i reduced major adverse cardiovascular events by 11% (HR 0.89 [95% CI 0.83-0.96], p=0.0014), with benefit only seen in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (0.86 [0.80-0.93]) and not in those without (1.00 [0.87-1.16], p for interaction=0.0501). SGLT2i reduced the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure by 23% (0.77 [0.71-0.84], p<0.0001), with a similar benefit in patients with and without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and with and without a history of heart failure. SGLT2i reduced the risk of progression of renal disease by 45% (0.55 [0.48-0.64], p<0.0001), with a similar benefit in those with and without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The magnitude of benefit of SGLT2i varied with baseline renal function, with greater reductions in hospitalisations for heart failure (p for interaction=0.0073) and lesser reductions in progression of renal disease (p for interaction=0.0258) in patients with more severe kidney disease at baseline. Interpretation SGLT2i have moderate benefits on atherosclerotic major adverse cardiovascular events that seem confined to patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, they have robust benefits on reducing hospitalisation for heart failure and progression of renal disease regardless of existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or a history of heart failure.

Obesity is associated with health problems such as increased risk for coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, various types of cancer, gallstones, and disability. Obesity is also associated with an increased risk for death, particularly among adults younger than 65 years. OBJECTIVE To update the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2012 recommendation on screening for obesity in adults. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on interventions (behavioral and pharmacotherapy) for weight loss or weight loss maintenance that can be provided in or referred from a primary care setting. Surgical weight loss interventions and nonsurgical weight loss devices (eg, gastric balloons) are considered to be outside the scope of the primary care setting. FINDINGS The USPSTF found adequate evidence that intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions in adults with obesity can lead to clinically significant improvements in weight status and reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes among adults with obesity and elevated plasma glucose levels; these interventions are of moderate benefit. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavior-based weight loss maintenance interventions are of moderate benefit. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions (including weight loss maintenance interventions) in adults with obesity are small to none. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that offering or referring adults with obesity to intensive behavioral interventions or behavior-based weight loss maintenance interventions has a moderate net benefit. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF recommends that clinicians offer or refer adults with a body mass index of 30 or higher to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions.

It is caused by toxigenic Vibrio cholerae O1 or O139 bacteria. Cholera is characterised by mild to potentially fatal acute watery diarrhoeal disease. Prompt rehydration therapy is the cornerstone of management. We present an overview of cholera and its pathogenesis, natural history, bacteriology, and epidemiology, while highlighting advances over the past 10 years in molecular epidemiology, immunology, and vaccine development and deployment. Since 2014, the Global Task Force on Cholera Control, a WHO coordinated network of partners, has been working with several countries to develop national cholera control strategies. The global roadmap for cholera control focuses on stopping transmission in cholera hotspots through vaccination and improved water, sanitation, and hygiene, with the aim to reduce cholera deaths by 90% and eliminate local transmission in at least 20 countries by 2030.","[Kanungo, Suman; Ramamurthy, Thandavarayan; Dutta, Shanta] Natl Inst Cholera & Enter Dis, Kolkata 700010, India; [Azman, Andrew S.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Epidemiol, Baltimore, MD USA; [Azman, Andrew S.] Univ Geneva, Inst Global Hlth, Fac Med, Geneva, Switzerland; [Deen, Jaqueline] Univ Philippines Manila, Inst Child Hlth & Human Dev, Natl Inst Hlth, Manila, Philippines",,"Dutta, S (corresponding author), Natl Inst Cholera & Enter Dis, Kolkata 700010, India.",shanta.niced@icmr.gov.in,,,"National Institutes of Health [R01 AI135115]; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation [INV021879, INV-002667]",National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationCGIAR),ASA is supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (R01 AI135115) and grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (INV021879 and INV-002667).

Importance Prevalence of hypertension (both primary and secondary) in children and adolescents in the US ranges from 3% to 4%. Primary hypertension in children and adolescents occurs primarily in children older than 13 years and has no known cause but is associated with several risk factors, including family history and higher body mass index. Secondary hypertension occurs primarily in younger children and is most commonly caused by genetic disorders, renal disease, endocrine disorders, or cardiovascular abnormalities. Objective To update its 2013 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening, test accuracy, the effectiveness and harms of treatment, and the association between hypertension and markers of cardiovascular disease in childhood and adulthood. Population This recommendation statement applies to children and adolescents aged 3 to 18 years not known to have hypertension or who are asymptomatic. Evidence Assessment The USPSTF concludes that the evidence to support screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.

Objective To review the evidence on screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Data Sources MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries through May 2019; references; experts; and literature surveillance through November 20, 2020. Study Selection English-language studies of screening with LDCT, accuracy of LDCT, risk prediction models, or treatment for early-stage lung cancer. Data Extraction and Synthesis Dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality; qualitative synthesis of findings. Data were not pooled because of heterogeneity of populations and screening protocols. Main Outcomes and Measures Lung cancer incidence, lung cancer mortality, all-cause mortality, test accuracy, and harms. Results This review included 223 publications. Seven randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (N = 86 486) evaluated lung cancer screening with LDCT; the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST, N = 53 454) and Nederlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek (NELSON, N = 15 792) were the largest RCTs. Participants were more likely to benefit than the US screening-eligible population (eg, based on life expectancy). The NLST found a reduction in lung cancer mortality (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75-0.96]; number needed to screen [NNS] to prevent 1 lung cancer death, 323 over 6.5 years of follow-up) with 3 rounds of annual LDCT screening compared with chest radiograph for high-risk current and former smokers aged 55 to 74 years. NELSON found a reduction in lung cancer mortality (IRR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.61-0.90]; NNS to prevent 1 lung cancer death of 130 over 10 years of follow-up) with 4 rounds of LDCT screening with increasing intervals compared with no screening for high-risk current and former smokers aged 50 to 74 years. Harms of screening included radiation-induced cancer, false-positive results leading to unnecessary tests and invasive procedures, overdiagnosis, incidental findings, and increases in distress. For every 1000 persons screened in the NLST, false-positive results led to 17 invasive procedures (number needed to harm, 59) and fewer than 1 person having a major complication. Overdiagnosis estimates varied greatly (0%-67% chance that a lung cancer was overdiagnosed). Incidental findings were common, and estimates varied widely (4.4%-40.7% of persons screened). Conclusions and Relevance Screening high-risk persons with LDCT can reduce lung cancer mortality but also causes false-positive results leading to unnecessary tests and invasive procedures, overdiagnosis, incidental findings, increases in distress, and, rarely, radiation-induced cancers. Most studies reviewed did not use current nodule evaluation protocols, which might reduce false-positive results and invasive procedures for false-positive results. This systematic review to support the 2021 US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement on screening for lung cancer summarizes published evidence about the relative benefits and harms of low-dose computed tomography to identify lung cancer in persons at high risk.","[Jonas, Daniel E.; Reddy, Shivani M.; Weber, Rachel Palmieri; Armstrong, Charli; Coker-Schwimmer, Manny; Middleton, Jennifer Cook; Voisin, Christiane] Univ N Carolina, RTI Int, Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Jonas, Daniel E.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Internal Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Reuland, Daniel S.; Harris, Russell P.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Med, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Reuland, Daniel S.; Weber, Rachel Palmieri; Armstrong, Charli; Coker-Schwimmer, Manny; Middleton, Jennifer Cook; Voisin, Christiane; Harris, Russell P.] Univ N Carolina, Cecil G Sheps Ctr Hlth Serv Res, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Reuland, Daniel S.; Malo, Teri L.; Brenner, Alison T.] Univ N Carolina, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Reddy, Shivani M.] RTI Int, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Nagle, Max] Univ Michigan, Michigan Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Clark, Stephen D.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Internal Med, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Enyioha, Chineme] Univ N Carolina, Dept Family Med, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA",,"Jonas, DE (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Internal Med, Div Gen Internal Med, 2050 Kenny Rd, Columbus, OH 43221 USA.",Daniel.Jonas@osumc.edu,,"Reddy, Shivani/0000-0003-2803-6155; Malo, Teri/0000-0002-5620-4841; Weber, Rachel/0000-0001-7119-7734",,,,,120,50,50,9,26,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

OBJECTIVES To articulate the definitional and conceptual issues around racism and health inequity and to describe how racism and health inequities are currently addressed in preventive health. METHODS An audit was conducted assessing (1) published literature on frameworks or policy and position statements addressing racism, (2) a subset of cancer and cardiovascular topics in USPSTF reports, (3) recent systematic reviews on interventions to reduce health inequities in preventive health or to prevent racism in health care, and (4) health care-relevant professional societies, guideline-making organizations, agencies, and funding bodies to gather information about how they are addressing racism and health equity. FINDINGS Race as a social category does not have biological underpinnings but has biological consequences through racism. Racism is complex and pervasive, operates at multiple interrelated levels, and exerts negative effects on other social determinants and health and well-being through multiple pathways. In its reports, the USPSTF has addressed racial and ethnic disparities, but not racism explicitly. The systematic reviews to support the USPSTF include interventions that may mitigate health disparities through cultural tailoring of behavioral interventions, but reviews have not explicitly addressed other commonly studied interventions to increase the uptake of preventive services or foster the implementation of preventive services. Many organizations have issued recent statements and commitments around racism in health care, but few have provided substantive guidance on operational steps to address the effects of racism. Where guidance is unavailable regarding the proposed actions, it is principally because work to achieve them is in very early stages. The most directly relevant and immediately useful guidance identified is that from the GRADE working group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This methods report provides a summary of issues around racism and health inequity, including the status of how these are being addressed in preventive health.","[Lin, Jennifer S.; Bean, Sarah, I; O'Connor, Elizabeth A.; Martin, Allea M.; Iacocca, Megan O.; Davies, Melinda C.] Kaiser Permanente, Kaiser Permanente Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Ctr Hlth Res, Portland, OR USA; [Hoffman, Lynn; Bacon, Olivia P.] Abt Associates Inc, Cambridge, MA USA",,"Lin, JS (corresponding author), Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Kaiser Permanente Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Ctr Hlth Res, 3800 N Interstate Ave, Portland, OR 97227 USA.",jennifer.s.lin@kpchr.org,,"Davies, Melinda/0000-0001-5123-215X","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA290201600006C]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA290201600006C from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, to support the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).",,71,7,7,2,4,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

The disease is caused by the toxin of the bacterium Clostridium tetani and is characterised by muscle spasms and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Global vaccination initiatives have had considerable success but they continue to face many challenges. Treatment for tetanus aims to control spasms and reduce cardiovascular instability, and consists of wound debridement, antitoxin, antibiotics, and supportive care. Recent research has focused on intravenous magnesium sulphate and intrathecal antitoxin administration as methods of spasm control that can avoid the need for ventilatory support. Nevertheless, without access to mechanical ventilation, mortality from tetanus remains high. Even with such care, patients require several weeks of hospitalisation and are vulnerable to secondary problems, such as hospital-acquired infections.","[Lam Minh Yen; Thwaites, C.

Persistent seizures are associated with a 20% to 40% risk of bodily injuries (eg, fractures, burns, concussions) over 12-month follow-up. The primary goal of epilepsy treatment is to eliminate seizures while minimizing adverse effects of antiseizure drugs (ASDs). OBSERVATIONS An epileptic seizure is defined as a sudden occurrence of transient signs and symptoms caused by abnormal and excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. Focal and generalized epilepsy are the 2 most frequent types of epilepsy; diagnosis is based on the type of seizures. There are 26 US Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for epilepsy, of which 24 have similar antiseizure efficacy for focal epilepsy and 9 have similar efficacy for generalized epilepsy. The decision to initiate an ASD should be individualized, but should be strongly considered after 2 unprovoked seizures or after 1 unprovoked seizure that occurred during sleep and/or in the presence of epileptiform activity on an electroencephalogram and/or in the presence of a structural lesion on the brain magnetic resonance imaging. The ASDs must be selected based on the seizure and epilepsy types, the epilepsy syndrome, and the adverse effects associated with the drug. For focal epilepsy, oxcarbazepine and lamotrigine are first-line therapy, while levetiracetam can be also considered if there is no history of psychiatric disorder. For generalized epilepsy, the selection of the ASD is based on the type of epilepsy syndrome and the patient's sex, age, and psychiatric history. Seizure freedom is achieved in approximately 60% to 70% of all patients. A total of 25% to 50% of patients also experience neurologic, psychiatric, cognitive, or medical disorders, such as mood, anxiety, and attention deficit disorders and migraines. For these patients, selecting an ASD should consider the presence of these disorders and concomitant use of medications to treat them. ASDs with cytochrome P450 enzyme-inducing properties (eg, carbamazepine, phenytoin) may worsen comorbid coronary and cerebrovascular disease by causing hyperlipidemia and accelerating the metabolism of concomitant drugs used for their treatment. They can also facilitate the development of osteopenia and osteoporosis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Epilepsy affects approximately 65 million people worldwide and is associated with increased rates of bodily injuries and mortality when not optimally treated. For focal and generalized epilepsy, selection of ASDs should consider the seizure and epilepsy types and epilepsy syndrome, as well as the patient's age and sex, comorbidities, and potential drug interactions.","[Kanner, Andres M.] Univ Miami, Comprehens Epilepsy Ctr, Miller Sch Med, Dept Neurol, 1120 NW 14th St,Room 1324, Miami, FL 33136 USA; Univ Miami, Epilepsy Div, Miller Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Miami, FL 33136 USA",,"Kanner, AM (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Comprehens Epilepsy Ctr, Miller Sch Med, Dept Neurol, 1120 NW 14th St,Room 1324, Miami, FL 33136 USA.",a.kanner@med.miami.edu,,,,,,,104,0,0,12,12,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

In 2017, there were 38 281 new diagnoses of HIV infection reported in the United States; 81% of these new diagnoses were among males and 19% were among females. Although treatable, HIV infection has no cure and has significant health consequences. OBJECTIVE To issue a new US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for the prevention of HIV infection. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits of PrEP for the prevention of HIV infection with oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate monotherapy or combined tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine and whether the benefits vary by risk group, population subgroup, or regimen or dosing strategy; the diagnostic accuracy of risk assessment tools to identify persons at high risk of HIV acquisition; the rates of adherence to PrEP in primary care settings; the association between adherence and effectiveness of PrEP; and the harms of PrEP when used for HIV prevention. FINDINGS The USPSTF found convincing evidence that PrEP is of substantial benefit in decreasing the risk of HIV infection in persons at high risk of HIV acquisition. The USPSTF also found convincing evidence that adherence to PrEP is highly associated with its efficacy in preventing the acquisition of HIV infection; thus, adherence to PrEP is central to realizing its benefit. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that PrEP is associated with small harms, including kidney and gastrointestinal adverse effects. The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that the magnitude of benefit of PrEP with oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-based therapy to reduce the risk of acquisition of HIV infection in persons at high risk is substantial. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF recommends offering PrEP with effective antiretroviral therapy to persons at high risk of HIV acquisition.

FindingsIn this randomized clinical trial that included 476 patients, the duration of symptoms was not significantly different for patients who received a 5-day course of ivermectin compared with placebo (median time to resolution of symptoms, 10 vs 12 days; hazard ratio for resolution of symptoms, 1.07). MeaningThe findings do not support the use of ivermectin for treatment of mild COVID-19, although larger trials may be needed to understand effects on other clinically relevant outcomes. ImportanceIvermectin is widely prescribed as a potential treatment for COVID-19 despite uncertainty about its clinical benefit. ObjectiveTo determine whether ivermectin is an efficacious treatment for mild COVID-19. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsDouble-blind, randomized trial conducted at a single site in Cali, Colombia. Potential study participants were identified by simple random sampling from the state's health department electronic database of patients with symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 during the study period. A total of 476 adult patients with mild disease and symptoms for 7 days or fewer (at home or hospitalized) were enrolled between July 15 and November 30, 2020, and followed up through December 21, 2020. InterventionPatients were randomized to receive ivermectin, 300 mu g/kg of body weight per day for 5 days (n=200) or placebo (n=200). Main Outcomes and MeasuresPrimary outcome was time to resolution of symptoms within a 21-day follow-up period. Solicited adverse events and serious adverse events were also collected. ResultsAmong 400 patients who were randomized in the primary analysis population (median age, 37 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 29-48]; 231 women [58%]), 398 (99.5%) completed the trial. The median time to resolution of symptoms was 10 days (IQR, 9-13) in the ivermectin group compared with 12 days (IQR, 9-13) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for resolution of symptoms, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.32]; P=.53 by log-rank test). By day 21, 82% in the ivermectin group and 79% in the placebo group had resolved symptoms. The most common solicited adverse event was headache, reported by 104 patients (52%) given ivermectin and 111 (56%) who received placebo. The most common serious adverse event was multiorgan failure, occurring in 4 patients (2 in each group). Conclusion and RelevanceAmong adults with mild COVID-19, a 5-day course of ivermectin, compared with placebo, did not significantly improve the time to resolution of symptoms. The findings do not support the use of ivermectin for treatment of mild COVID-19, although larger trials may be needed to understand the effects of ivermectin on other clinically relevant outcomes. Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04405843 This randomized trial compares the effects of ivermectin vs placebo on time to symptom resolution within 21 days among patients with mild COVID-19.","[Krist, Alex H.] Fairfax Family Practice Residency, Fairfax, VA USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, 830 E Main St One Capitol Sq,Sixth Floor, Richmond, VA 23219 USA; [Davidson, Karina W.] Feinstein Inst Med Res Northwell Hlth, New York, NY USA; [Mangione, Carol M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Cabana, Michael] Albert Einstein Coll Med, New York, NY USA; [Caughey, Aaron B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Davis, Esa M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Donahue, Katrina E.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Doubeni, Chyke A.] Mayo Clin, Rochester, MN USA; [Epling, John W., Jr.] Virginia Tech, Carilion Sch Med, Roanoke, VA USA; [Kubik, Martha] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Li, Li] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Ogedegbe, Gbenga] NYU, New York, NY USA; [Owens, Douglas K.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pbert, Lori] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Worcester, MA USA; [Silverstein, Michael] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Stevermer, James] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Univ Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Pacific Hlth Res & Educ Inst, Honolulu, HI USA; [Wong, John B.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02111 USA",,"Krist, AH (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, 830 E Main St One Capitol Sq,Sixth Floor, Richmond, VA 23219 USA.",,,"Epling, John W/0000-0001-9445-8669",,,,,33,11,11,2,6,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum can cause corneal scarring, ocular perforation, and blindness as early as 24 hours after birth. In the absence of ocular prophylaxis, transmission rates of gonococcal infection from mother to newborn are 30% to 50%. OBJECTIVE To reaffirm the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2011 recommendation on ocular prophylaxis for gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF commissioned a reaffirmation evidence update to identify new and substantial evidence sufficient enough to change its prior recommendation. FINDINGS Using a reaffirmation process, the USPSTF found no new data that would change its previous conclusion that topical ocular prophylaxis is effective in preventing gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum and related ocular conditions. The USPSTF found no new data that would change its previous conclusion that there is convincing evidence that topical ocular prophylaxis of all newborns is not associated with serious harms. Therefore, the USPSTF reaffirms its previous conclusion that there is convincing evidence that topical ocular prophylaxis for all newborns provides substantial benefit.

Methods In the Peanut Allergen immunotherapy, Clarifying the Evidence (PACE) systematic review and metaanalysis, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials, Latin American & Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WHO's Clinical Trials Registry Platform, US Food and Drug Administration, and European Medicines Agency databases from inception to Dec 6, 2018, for randomised controlled trials comparing oral immunotherapy versus no oral immunotherapy for peanut allergy, without language restrictions. We screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias independently in duplicate. Main outcomes included anaphylaxis, allergic or adverse reactions, epinephrine use, and quality of life, meta-analysed by random effects. We assessed certainty (quality) of evidence by the GRADE approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019117930. Findings 12 trials (n=1041; median age across trials 8.7 years [IQR 5.9-11.2]) showed that oral immunotherapy versus no oral immunotherapy increased anaphylaxis risk (risk ratio [RR] 3.12 [95% CI 1.76-5.55], I-2=0%, risk difference [RD] 15.1%, high-certainty), anaphylaxis frequency (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 2.72 [1.57-4.72], I-2=0%, RD 12.2%, high-certainty), and epinephrine use (RR 2.21 [1.27-3.83], I-2=0%, RD 4.5%, high-certainty) similarly during build-up and maintenance (p interaction=0.92). Oral immunotherapy increased serious adverse events (RR 1.92 [1.00-3.66], I-2=0%, RD 5.7%, moderate-certainty), and non-anaphylactic reactions (vomiting: RR 1.79 [95% CI 1.35-2.38], I-2=0%, high-certainty; angioedema: 2.25 [1.13-4.47], I-2=0%, high-certainty; upper tract respiratory reactions: 1.36 [1.02-1.81], I-2=0%, moderate-certainty; lower tract respiratory reactions: 1.55 [0.96-2.50], I-2=28%, moderate-certainty). Passing a supervised challenge, a surrogate for preventing out-of-clinic reactions, was more likely with oral immunotherapy (RR 12.42 [95% CI 6.82-22.61], I-2=0%, RD 36.5%, high-certainty). Quality of life was not different between groups (combined parents and self report RR 1.21 [0.87-1.69], I-2=0%, RD 0.03%, lowcertainty). Findings were robust to IRR, trial sequential, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses. Interpretation In patients with peanut allergy, high-certainty evidence shows that available peanut oral immunotherapy regimens considerably increase allergic and anaphylactic reactions over avoidance or placebo, despite effectively inducing desensitisation. Safer peanut allergy treatment approaches and rigorous randomised controlled trials that evaluate patient-important outcomes are needed.","[Chu, Derek K.; French, Shannon; Waserman, Susan; Brozek, Jan L.; Schuenemann, Holger J.] McMaster Univ, Dept Med, Hamilton, ON L85 4K1, Canada; [French, Shannon] McMaster Univ, Dept Pediat, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Jordana, Manel] McMaster Univ, Dept Pathol & Mol Med, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Brozek, Jan L.; Schuenemann, Holger J.] McMaster Univ, Dept Hlth Res Methods Evidence & Impact, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Chu, Derek K.; French, Shannon; Waserman, Susan; Schuenemann, Holger J.] St Josephs Healthcare Hamilton, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Wood, Robert A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Div Allergy & Immunol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Fiocchi, Alessandro] Bambino Gesu Pediat Hosp, Ist Ricovero & Cura Caratte Re Scientif, Allergy Div, Rome, Italy; [Brozek, Jan L.; Schuenemann, Holger J.] Michael G DeGroote Cochrane Canada Ctr, Hamilton, ON, Canada",,"Chu, DK (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Dept Med, Hamilton, ON L85 4K1, Canada.",chudk@mcmaster.ca,"Fiocchi, Alessandro/K-9235-2016","Fiocchi, Alessandro/0000-0002-2549-0523; Schunemann, Holger/0000-0003-3211-8479; Chu, Derek/0000-0001-8269-4496",,,,,66,164,166,8,48,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,JUN 1,2019,393,10187,,,,,2222,2232,,10.1016/S0140-6736(19)30420-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(19)30420-9,,,11,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,IB1HV,31030987,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000470017100026,View Full Record in Web of Science,86629,0,5,6,25,55,48,47,39,60,26,24,52,52,52,19,48

OBJECTIVE To update the evidence for benefits and harms of vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling adults to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force. DATA SOURCES PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries through March 21, 2017; references; and experts. Surveillance continued through February 28, 2018. STUDY SELECTION English-language randomized clinical trials (RCTs) or observational studies of supplementation with vitamin D, calcium, or both among adult populations; studies of populations that were institutionalized or had known vitamin D deficiency, osteoporosis, or prior fracture were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Dual, independent review of titles/abstracts and full-text articles and study quality rating using predefined criteria. Random-effects meta-analysis used when at least 3 similar studies were available. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident fracture, mortality, kidney stones, cardiovascular events, and cancer. RESULTS Eleven RCTs (N = 51 419) in adults 50 years and older conducted over 2 to 7 years were included. Compared with placebo, supplementation with vitamin D decreased total fracture incidence (1 RCT [n = 2686]; absolute risk difference [ARD], -2.26%[95% CI, -4.53% to 0.00%]) but had no significant association with hip fracture (3 RCTs [n = 5496]; pooled ARD, -0.01% [95% CI, -0.80% to 0.78%]). Supplementation using vitamin D with calcium had no effect on total fracture incidence (1 RCT [n = 36 282]; ARD, -0.35%[95% CI, -1.02% to 0.31%]) or hip fracture incidence (2 RCTs [n = 36 727]; ARD from the larger trial, -0.14%[95% CI, -0.34% to 0.07%]). The evidence for calcium alone was limited, with only 2 studies (n = 339 total) and very imprecise results. Supplementation with vitamin D alone or with calcium had no significant effect on all-cause mortality or incident cardiovascular disease; ARDs ranged from -1.93% to 1.79%, with CIs consistent with no significant differences. Supplementation using vitamin D with calcium was associated with an increased incidence of kidney stones (3 RCTs [n = 39 213]; pooled ARD, 0.33%[95% CI, 0.06% to 0.60%]), but supplementation with calcium alone was not associated with an increased risk (3 RCTs [n = 1259]; pooled ARD, 0.00% [95% CI, -0.87% to 0.87%]). Supplementation with vitamin D and calcium was not associated with an increase in cancer incidence (3 RCTs [n = 39 213]; pooled ARD, -1.48%[95% CI, -3.32% to 0.35%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Vitamin D supplementation alone or with calcium was not associated with reduced fracture incidence among community-dwelling adults without known vitamin D deficiency, osteoporosis, or prior fracture. Vitamin D with calcium was associated with an increase in the incidence of kidney stones.","[Kahwati, Leila C.; Weber, Rachel Palmieri; Pan, Huiling; Gourlay, Margaret; Coker-Schwimmer, Manny; Viswanathan, Meera] Univ N Carolina, RTI Int, Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Kahwati, Leila C.; Pan, Huiling; Viswanathan, Meera] RTI Int, 3040 E Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Weber, Rachel Palmieri; Coker-Schwimmer, Manny] Univ N Carolina, Cecil G Sheps Ctr Hlth Serv Res, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Gourlay, Margaret] Univ N Carolina, Sch Med, Dept Family Med, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [LeBlanc, Erin] Kaiser Permanente, Ctr Hlth Res Northwest, Portland, OR USA",,"Kahwati, LC (corresponding author), RTI Int, 3040 E Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",lkahwati@rti.org,,"Weber, Rachel/0000-0001-7119-7734; Kahwati, Leila/0000-0001-6963-2848","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA-290-2015-00011-I]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA-290-2015-00011-I, Task Order 5, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the USPSTF.",,39,97,102,2,44,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

However, since 2017 unprecedented growth has been seen in the number of drugs available for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia, with several new drugs receiving regulatory approval. In addition to advancing our therapeutic armamentarium, an increased understanding of the biology and genomic architecture of acute myeloid leukaemia has led to refined risk assessment of this disease, with consensus risk stratification guidelines now incorporating a growing number of recurrent molecular aberrations that aid in the selection of risk-adapted management strategies. Despite this promising recent progress, the outcomes of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia remain unsatisfactory, with more than half of patients ultimately dying from their disease. Enrolment of patients into clinical trials that evaluate novel drugs and rational combination therapies is imperative to continuing this progress and further improving the outcomes of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia.","[Short, Nicholas J.; Rytting, Michael E.; Cortes, Jorge E.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Leukemia, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Rytting, Michael E.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Pediat Patient Care, Houston, TX 77030 USA",,"Cortes, JE (corresponding author), Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Leukemia, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",jcortes@mdanderson.org,"Short, Nicholas/I-3319-2019","Short, Nicholas/0000-0002-2983-2738",NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE [K12CA088084] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NCI NIH HHS [K12 CA088084] Funding Source: Medline,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); NCI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)),,,135,275,288,41,141,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,AUG 18,2018,392,10147,,,,,593,606,,10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31041-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31041-9,,,14,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,GQ8MN,30078459,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000442009500025,View Full Record in Web of Science,87168,0,47,49,53,7,60,8,17,128,85,29,102,127,64,83,119

Its widespread prevalence, and associated disability, have a range of negative and substantial effects not only on those immediately affected but also on their families, colleagues, employers, and society. To reduce this global burden, concerted efforts are needed to implement and improve migraine care that is supported by informed health-care policies. In this Series paper, we summarise the data on migraine epidemiology, including estimates of its very considerable burden on the global economy. First, we present the challenges that continue to obstruct provision of adequate care worldwide. Second, we outline the advantages of integrated and coordinated systems of care, in which primary and specialist care complement and support each other; the use of comprehensive referral and linkage protocols should enable continuity of care between these systems levels. Finally, we describe challenges in low and middle-income countries, including countries with poor public health education, inadequate access to medication, and insufficient formal education and training of health-care professionals resulting in misdiagnosis, mismanagement, and wastage of resources.","[Ashina, Messoud; Thien Phu Do; Younis, Samaira] Univ Copenhagen, Danish Headache Ctr, Dept Neurol, Rigshosp Glostrup,Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Ashina, Messoud] Danish Knowledge Ctr Headache Disorders, Glostrup, Denmark; [Ashina, Messoud] Azerbaijan Med Univ, Dept Neurol, Baku, Azerbaijan; [Katsarava, Zaza] Evangelical Hosp Unna, Dept Neurol, Unna, Germany; [Katsarava, Zaza] Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Neurol, Essen, Germany; [Katsarava, Zaza] EVEX Med Corp, Tbilisi, GA USA; [Ashina, Messoud; Katsarava, Zaza] IM Sechenov First Moscow State Med Univ, Dept Neurol, Moscow, Russia; [Buse, Dawn C.; Lipton, Richard B.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Neurol, Bronx, NY USA; [Pozo-Rosich, Patricia] Hosp Univ Vall dHebron, Neurol Dept, Headache Unit, 5, Barcelona, Spain; [Pozo-Rosich, Patricia] Univ Autbnoma Barcelona, Vail dHebron Res Inst, Dept Med, Headache & Neurol Pain Res Grp, Barcelona, Spain; [Ozge, Aynur] Mersin Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Mersin, Turkey; [Krymchantowski, Abouch, V] Headache Ctr Rio, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Lebedeva, Elena R.] Ural State Med Univ, Int Headache Ctr Europe Asia, Dept Neurol, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Ravishankar, Krishnamurthy] Jaslok Hosp & Res Ctr, Lilavati Hosp & Res Ctr, Headache & Migraine Clin, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Yu, Shengyuan] Peoples Liberat Army Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sacco, Simona] Univ Aquila, Dept Appl Clin Sci & Biotechnol, Neurosci Sect, Laquila, Italy; [Ashina, Sait] Harvard Med Sch, Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Comprehens Headache Ctr, Dept Neurol & Anesthesia, Boston, MA USA; [Steiner, Timothy J.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Neuromed & Movement Sci, Trondheim, Norway; [Steiner, Timothy J.] Imperial Coll London, Div Brain Sci, London, England; [Lipton, Richard B.] Montefiore Med Ctr, 111 E 210th St, Bronx, NY 10467 USA",,"Ashina, M (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Danish Headache Ctr, Dept Neurol, Rigshosp Glostrup, DK-2600 Copenhagen, Denmark.",ashina@dadlnet.dk,"Sacco, Simona/I-5253-2012; Lipton, Richard Bruce/AAY-2818-2021; Ashina, Messoud/AFU-1246-2022","Sacco, Simona/0000-0003-0651-1939; Ashina, Messoud/0000-0003-0951-5804; Ashina, Sait/0000-0003-3973-6640",,,,,93,65,67,20,31,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,APR 17,2021,397,10283,,,,,1485,1495,,10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32160-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32160-7,,APR 2021,11,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,RN5FX,33773613,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000640378100026,View Full Record in Web of Science,87250,0,2,76,82,82,93,33,32,22,39,14,38,20,16,80,12

The outlook for many individuals with autism spectrum disorder today is brighter than it was 50 years ago; more people with the condition are able to speak, read, and live in the community rather than in institutions, and some will be largely free from symptoms of the disorder by adulthood. Nevertheless, most individuals will not work full-time or live independently. Genetics and neuroscience have identified intriguing patterns of risk, but without much practical benefit yet. Considerable work is still needed to understand how and when behavioural and medical treatments can be effective, and for which children, including those with substantial comorbidities. It is also important to implement what we already know and develop services for adults with autism spectrum disorder. Clinicians can make a difference by providing timely and individualised help to families navigating referrals and access to community support systems, by providing accurate information despite often unfiltered media input, and by anticipating transitions such as family changes and school entry and leaving.","[Lord, Catherine] Cornell Univ, Weill Cornell Med, NewYork Presbyterian Hosp, Ctr Autism & Dev Brain, White Plains, NY USA; [Elsabbagh, Mayada] McGill Univ, Dept Neurol & Neurosurg, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Baird, Gillian] Kings Hlth Partners, Evelina Childrens Hosp, London, England; [Veenstra-Vanderweele, Jeremy] Columbia Univ, New York State Psychiat Inst, Div Child & Adolescent Psychiat,Dept Psychiat, Ctr Autism & Dev Brain,NewYork Presbyterian Hosp, White Plains, NY USA",,"Lord, C (corresponding author), New York Presbyterian Hosp, Ctr Autism & Dev Brain, White Plains, NY 10605 USA.",cal2028@med.cornell.edu,,"Elsabbagh, Mayada/0000-0002-7311-9059","National Institute of Mental Health [R01MH104423-04, R01HD081199-04]; Mortimer D Sackler, MD Professorship; Fonds de Recherche du Quebec-Sante; Canadian Institutes for Health Research; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT [R01HD081199] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH [R01MH104423] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); Mortimer D Sackler, MD Professorship; Fonds de Recherche du Quebec-Sante(Fonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec); Canadian Institutes for Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))","We thank Anya Urcuyo, Nancy Jaramillo, and Juliana Boucher (from Weill Cornell Medicine for their excellent help in preparing this manuscript, and David Skuse from Great Ormond Street Hospital for information and advice.

Objective To update the evidence on screening and treatment of hypertension in childhood and adolescence for the US Preventive Services Task Force. Data Sources PubMed, Cochrane Library, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, EMBASE, and trial registries through September 3, 2019; bibliographies from retrieved articles, experts, and surveillance of the literature through October 6, 2020. Study Selection Fair- or good-quality English-language studies evaluating diagnostic accuracy of blood pressure screening; cohort studies assessing the association of hypertension in childhood and adolescence with blood pressure or other intermediate outcomes in adulthood; randomized clinical trials (RCTs) or meta-analyses of pharmacological and lifestyle interventions. Data Extraction and Synthesis Two reviewers independently assessed titles/abstracts and full-text articles, extracted data, and assessed study quality; the evidence was synthesized qualitatively. Main Outcomes and Measures Sensitivity, specificity, and measures of association between childhood and adulthood blood pressure; reduction of childhood blood pressure; adverse effects of treatments. Results Forty-two studies from 43 publications were included (N>12 400). No studies evaluated the benefits or harms of screening and the effect of treating childhood hypertension on outcomes in adulthood. One study reported a sensitivity of 0.82 and a specificity of 0.70 for 2 office-based blood pressure measurements. Twenty observational studies suggested a significant association between childhood hypertension and abnormal blood pressure in adulthood (odds ratios, 1.1-4.5; risk ratios, 1.45-3.60; hazard ratios, 2.8-3.2). Thirteen placebo-controlled RCTs and 1 meta-analysis assessed reductions in systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure from pharmacological treatments. Pooled reductions of SBP were -4.38 mm Hg (95% CI, -7.27 to -2.16) for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and -3.07 mm Hg (95% CI, -4.99 to -1.44) for angiotensin receptor blockers. Candesartan reduced SBP by -6.56 mm Hg (P < .001; n = 240). beta-Blockers, calcium channel blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists did not achieve significant reductions over 2 to 4 weeks. SBP was significantly reduced by exercise over 8 months (-4.9 mm Hg, P <= .05; n = 69), by dietary approaches to stop hypertension over 3 months (-2.2 mm Hg, P < .01; n = 57), and by a combination of drug treatment and lifestyle interventions over 6 months (-7.6 mm Hg; P < .001; n = 95). Low-salt diet did not achieve reductions of blood pressure. Conclusions and Relevance Observational studies indicate an association between hypertension in childhood and hypertension in adulthood. However, the evidence is inconclusive whether the diagnostic accuracy of blood pressure measurements is adequate for screening asymptomatic children and adolescents in primary care. This systematic review to support the 2020 US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement on screening for hypertension in children and adolescents summarizes published evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for hypertension in asymptomatic children and adolescents and on the effect of treating childhood hypertension on outcomes in adulthood.","[Gartlehner, Gerald; Vander Schaaf, Emily B.; Orr, Colin; Kennedy, Sara M.; Clark, Rachel; Viswanathan, Meera] Univ N Carolina, RTI Int, Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Gartlehner, Gerald; Kennedy, Sara M.; Viswanathan, Meera] RTI Int, 3040 E Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Gartlehner, Gerald] Danube Univ, Dept Evidence Based Med & Evaluat, Krems, Austria; [Vander Schaaf, Emily B.; Orr, Colin] Univ N Carolina, Dept Pediat, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA",,"Gartlehner, G (corresponding author), RTI Int, 3040 E Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",ggartlehner@rti.org,"Gartlehner, Gerald/AAY-2801-2021; Orr, Colin/AAZ-5971-2021","Gartlehner, Gerald/0000-0001-5531-3678; Orr, Colin/0000-0002-0729-238X; , Emily/0000-0002-1408-7413",,,,,68,12,14,2,4,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

The prevalence of AF increases with age, from less than 02% in adults younger than 55 years to about 10% in those 85 years or older, with a higher prevalence in men than in women. It is uncertain whether the prevalence of AF differs by race and ethnicity. Atrial fibrillation is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke and is associated with a substantial increase in the risk of stroke. Approximately 20% of patients who have a stroke associated with AF are first diagnosed with AF at the time of the stroke or shortly thereafter. OBJECTIVE To update its 2018 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on the benefits and harms of screening for AF in older adults, the accuracy of screening tests, the effectiveness of screening tests to detect previously undiagnosed AF compared with usual care, and the benefits and harms of anticoagulant therapy for the treatment of screen-detected AF in older adults. POPULATION Adults 50 years or older without a diagnosis or symptoms of AF and without a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke. EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT The USPSTF concludes that evidence is lacking, and the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AF in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined. RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AF.","[Davidson, Karina W.] Northwell Hlth, Feinstein Inst Med Res, New York, NY USA; [Barry, Michael J.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Mangione, Carol M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Cabana, Michael] Albert Einstein Coll Med, New York, NY USA; [Caughey, Aaron B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Davis, Esa M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Donahue, Katrina E.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Doubeni, Chyke A.] Mayo Clin, Rochester, MN USA; [Epling, John W.] Virginia Tech, Carilion Sch Med, Roanoke, VA USA; [Kubik, Martha] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Li, Li] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Ogedegbe, Gbenga] NYU, New York, NY USA; [Pbert, Lori] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Worcester, MA USA; [Silverstein, Michael] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Stevermer, James] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Univ Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Pacific Hlth Res & Educ Inst, Honolulu, HI USA; [Wong, John B.] Tufts Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02111 USA",,"Davidson, KW (corresponding author), Feinstein Inst Med Res, 130 E 59th St,Ste 14C, New York, NY 10032 USA.",chair@uspstf.net,,,,,,,43,12,12,4,4,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Nonetheless, existing global, national, and subnational data provide some key opportunities for testing associations between gender norms and health. Using innovative approaches to analysing proxies for gender norms, we generated evidence that gender norms impact the health of women and men across life stages, health sectors, and world regions. Six case studies showed that: (1) gender norms are complex and can intersect with other social factors to impact health over the life course; (2) early gender-normative influences by parents and peers can have multiple and differing health consequences for girls and boys; (3) non-conformity with, and transgression of, gender norms can be harmful to health, particularly when they trigger negative sanctions; and (4) the impact of gender norms on health can be context-specific, demanding care when designing effective gender-transformative health policies and programmes. Limitations of survey-based data are described that resulted in missed opportunities for investigating certain populations and domains. Recommendations for optimising and advancing research on the health impacts of gender norms are made.","[Weber, Ann M.; Abdalla, Safa; Bhushan, Devika; Gupta, Ribhav; Darmstadt, Gary L.; Darmstadt, Gary] Stanford Univ, Dept Pediat, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Domingue, Benjamin W.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Mejia-Guevara, Ivan] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Cislaghi, Beniamino] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London, England; [Meausoone, Valerie; Mejia-Guevara, Ivan; Loftus, Pooja; Hallgren, Emma; Cullen, Mark R.; Darmstadt, Gary L.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Populat Hlth Sci, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Seff, Ilana] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Populat & Family Hlth, New York, NY USA; [Stark, Lindsay] Washington Univ, Brown Sch, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Victora, Cesar G.; Buffarini, Romina; Barros, Aluisio J.

This Series paper describes the dynamics of the DBM in LMICs and how it differs by socioeconomic level. This Series paper shows that the DBM has increased in the poorest LMICs, mainly due to overweight and obesity increases. Indonesia is the largest country with a severe DBM, but many other Asian and sub-Saharan African countries also face this problem. We also discuss that overweight increases are mainly due to very rapid changes in the food system, particularly the availability of cheap ultra-processed food and beverages in LMICs, and major reductions in physical activity at work, transportation, home, and even leisure due to introductions of activity-saving technologies. Understanding that the lowest income LMICs face severe levels of the DBM and that the major direct cause is rapid increases in overweight allows identifying selected crucial drivers and possible options for addressing the DBM at all levels.","[Popkin, Barry M.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Nutr, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Popkin, Barry M.] Univ N Carolina, Carolina Populat Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27516 USA; [Corvalan, Camila] Univ Chile, Inst Nutr & Food Technol INTA, Santiago, Chile; [Grummer-Strawn, Laurence M.] WHO, Dept Nutr Hlth & Dev, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Popkin, BM (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Carolina Populat Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27516 USA.",popkin@unc.edu,"Corvalan, Camila/B-2914-2011","Corvalan, Camila/0000-0003-3766-7709","National Institutes of Health [R01DK108148, P2C HD050924]; WHO; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation",National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); WHO(World Health Organization); Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationCGIAR),"Funding is from the National Institutes of Health (R01DK108148 and P2C HD050924).

Rates of recurrent VTE range from 20% to 36% during the 10 years after an initial event. ObservationsPubMed and Cochrane databases were searched for English-language studies published from January 2015 through June 2020 for randomized clinical trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and observational studies. Risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE), such as older age, malignancy (cumulative incidence of 7.4% after a median of 19 months), inflammatory disorders (VTE risk is 4.7% in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 2.5% in those without), and inherited thrombophilia (factor V Leiden carriers with a 10-year cumulative incidence of 10.9%), are associated with higher risk of VTE. Patients with signs or symptoms of lower extremity DVT, such as swelling (71%) or a cramping or pulling discomfort in the thigh or calf (53%), should undergo assessment of pretest probability followed by D-dimer testing and imaging with venous ultrasonography. A normal D-dimer level (ie, D-dimer <500 ng/mL) excludes acute VTE when combined with a low pretest probability (ie, Wells DVT score <less than or equal to>1). In patients with a high pretest probability, the negative predictive value of a D-dimer less than 500 ng/mL is 92%. Consequently, D-dimer cannot be used to exclude DVT without an assessment of pretest probability. Postthrombotic syndrome, defined as persistent symptoms, signs of chronic venous insufficiency, or both, occurs in 25% to 50% of patients 3 to 6 months after DVT diagnosis. Catheter-directed fibrinolysis with or without mechanical thrombectomy is appropriate in those with iliofemoral obstruction, severe symptoms, and a low risk of bleeding. The efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants-rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban-is noninferior to warfarin (absolute rate of recurrent VTE or VTE-related death, 2.0% vs 2.2%). Major bleeding occurs in 1.1% of patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants vs 1.8% treated with warfarin. Conclusions and RelevanceGreater recognition of VTE risk factors and advances in anticoagulation have facilitated the clinical evaluation and treatment of patients with DVT. Direct oral anticoagulants are noninferior to warfarin with regard to efficacy and are associated with lower rates of bleeding, but costs limit use for some patients.

Without hearing rehabilitation, hearing loss can cause detrimental effects on speech, language, developmental, educational, and cognitive outcomes in children. ObservationsConsequences of hearing loss in children include worse outcomes in speech, language, education, social functioning, cognitive abilities, and quality of life. Hearing loss can be congenital, delayed onset, or acquired with possible etiologies including congenital infections, genetic causes including syndromic and nonsyndromic etiologies, and trauma, among others. Evaluation of hearing loss must be based on suspected diagnosis, type, laterality and degree of hearing loss, age of onset, and additional variables such as exposure to cranial irradiation. Hearing rehabilitation for children with hearing loss may include use of hearing aids, cochlear implants, bone anchored devices, or use of assistive devices such as frequency modulating systems. Conclusions and RelevanceHearing loss in children is common, and there has been substantial progress in diagnosis and management of these cases. Early identification of hearing loss and understanding its etiology can assist with prognosis and counseling of families. In addition, awareness of treatment strategies including the many hearing device options, cochlear implant, and assistive devices can help direct management of the patient to optimize outcomes. This narrative review summarizes the etiologies of pediatric hearing loss, screening strategies for identifying it early, consequences of delayed diagnosis, and diagnosis and management of the condition, with a detailed discussion of criteria for choice of hearing devices to remediate hearing impairment.","[Lieu, Judith E.

In the second paper of this Series on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, we considered important issues in the prehospital management of cardiac arrest. Successful resuscitation relies on a strong chain of survival with the community, dispatch centre, ambulance, and hospital working together. Early cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation has the greatest impact on survival. If the community response does not restart the heart, resuscitation is continued by emergency medical services' staff. However, the best approaches for airway management and the effectiveness of currently used drug treatments are uncertain. Prognostic factors and rules for termination of resuscitation could guide the duration of a resuscitation attempt and decision to transport to hospital. If return of spontaneous circulation is achieved, the focus of treatment shifts to stabilisation, restoration of normal physiological parameters, and transportation to hospital for ongoing care.","[Ong, Marcus Eng Hock] Singapore Gen Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Singapore 169856, Singapore; [Ong, Marcus Eng Hock] Duke NUS Med Sch, Hlth Serv & Syst Res, Singapore, Singapore; [Perkins, Gavin D.] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Warwick Clin Trials Unit, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Perkins, Gavin D.] Heart England NHS Fdn Trust, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Cariou, Alain] Cochin Hosp, AP HP, Med Intens Care Unit, Paris, France; [Cariou, Alain] Paris Descartes Univ, Paris, France",,"Ong, MEH (corresponding author), Singapore Gen Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Singapore 169856, Singapore.",marcus.ong.e.h@singhealth.com.sg,"Perkins, Gavin D/E-7613-2010","Perkins, Gavin/0000-0003-3027-7548",National Institute of Health Research Senior (NIHR) Investigator; NIHR; Bard; AstraZeneca,National Institute of Health Research Senior (NIHR) Investigator(National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)); NIHR(National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)); Bard(US-Israel Binational Science Foundation); AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca),"MEHO is currently scientific adviser to Global Healthcare SG and TIIM SG, and holds patents related to using heart rate variability and artificial intelligence for medical monitoring.

The Rational Clinical Examination Systematic Review,JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION,,,English,Review,,,,,,,AMBULATORY BLOOD-PRESSURE; WHITE-COAT; MASKED HYPERTENSION; OFFICE; HOME; METAANALYSIS; ACCURACY,"IMPORTANCE Office blood pressure (BP) measurements are not the most accurate method to diagnose hypertension. Home BP monitoring (HBPM) and 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) are out-of-office alternatives, and ABPM is considered the reference standard for BP assessment. OBJECTIVE To systematically review the accuracy of oscillometric office and home BP measurement methods for correctly classifying adults as having hypertension, defined using ABPM. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and DARE databases and the American Heart Association website (from inception to April 2021) were searched, along with reference lists from retrieved articles. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two authors independently abstracted rawdata and assessed methodological quality. A third author resolved disputes as needed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Random effects summary sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) were calculated for BP measurement methods for the diagnosis of hypertension. ABPM (24-hour mean BP >= 130/80mmHg or mean BP while awake >= 135/85mmHg) was considered the reference standard. RESULTS A total of 12 cross-sectional studies (n = 6877) that compared conventional oscillometric office BP measurements to mean BP during 24-hour ABPM and 6 studies (n = 2049) that compared mean BP on HBPM to mean BP during 24-hour ABPM were included (range, 117-2209 participants per analysis); 2 of these studies (n = 3040) used consecutive samples. The overall prevalence of hypertension identified by 24-hour ABPM was 49% (95% CI, 39%-60%) in the pooled studies that evaluated office measures and 54% (95% CI, 39%-69%) in studies that evaluated HBPM. All included studies assessed sensitivity and specificity at the office BP threshold of 140/90mmHg and the home BP threshold of 135/85mmHg. Conventional office oscillometric measurement (1-5 measurements in a single visit with BP >= 140/90mmHg) had a sensitivity of 51% (95% CI, 36%-67%), specificity of 88%(95% CI, 80%-96%), positive LR of 4.2 (95% CI, 2.5-6.0), and negative LR of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.42-0.69). Mean BP with HBPM (with BP >= 135/85mmHg) had a sensitivity of 75%(95% CI, 65%-86%), specificity of 76%(95% CI, 65%-86%), positive LR of 3.1 (95% CI, 2.2-4.0), and negative LR of 0.33 (95% CI, 0.20-0.47). Two studies (1 with a consecutive sample) that compared unattended automated mean office BP (with BP >= 135/85mmHg) with 24-hour ABPM had sensitivity ranging from 48% to 51% and specificity ranging from 80% to 91%. One study that compared attended automated mean office BP (with BP >= 140/90mmHg) with 24-hour ABPM had a sensitivity of 87.6%(95% CI, 83%-92%) and specificity of 24.1% (95% CI, 16%-32%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Office measurements of BP may not be accurate enough to rule in or rule out hypertension; HBPM may be helpful to confirm a diagnosis. When there is uncertainty around threshold values or when office and HBPM are not in agreement, 24-hour ABPM should be considered to establish the diagnosis.","[Viera, Anthony J.; Yano, Yuichiro] Duke Univ, Dept Family Med & Community Hlth, Sch Med, Durham, NC 27705 USA; [Yano, Yuichiro] Yokohama City Univ, Ctr Novel & Exploratory Clin Trials, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Lin, Feng-Chang] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biostat, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Simel, David L.] Duke Univ, Durham Vet Affairs Hlth Syst, Sch Med, Durham, NC 27705 USA; [Simel, David L.] Duke Univ, Dept Med, Sch Med, Durham, NC 27705 USA; [Yun, Jonathan] Maine Gen Internal Med, Waterville, ME USA; [Dave, Gaurav; Jonas, Daniel E.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Med, Div Gen Internal Med & Clin Epidemiol, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Von Holle, Ann] Res Triangle Pk, Durham, NC USA; [Viera, Laura A.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, North Carolina Translat & Clin Sci Inst, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Shimbo, Daichi] Columbia Univ, Dept Med, Irving Med Ctr, New York, NY USA; [Hardy, Shakia T.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Epidemiol, Birmingham, AL USA; [Donahue, Katrina E.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Family Med, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Donahue, Katrina E.; Voisin, Christiane E.; Jonas, Daniel E.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Sheps Ctr Hlth Serv Res, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Hinderliter, Alan] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Div Cardiol, Dept Med, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Jonas, Daniel E.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Internal Med, Div Gen Internal Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",,"Viera, AJ (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Sch Med, 2200 W Main St,Ste 400, Durham, NC 27705 USA.",anthony.viera@duke.edu,,"Dave, Gaurav/0000-0003-0825-1595; Hardy, Shakia/0000-0001-9211-0474","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Health Resources and Services Administration [T32-HP14001]; Durham Center of Innovation to Accelerate Discovery and Practice Transformation (ADAPT) at the Durham VA Health Care System [CIN 13-410]; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [R01HL139716]","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI)); Health Resources and Services Administration(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Health Resources & Service Administration (HRSA)); Durham Center of Innovation to Accelerate Discovery and Practice Transformation (ADAPT) at the Durham VA Health Care System; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI))","Dr Viera reported past funding from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to study out-of-office blood pressure monitoring.

Mutations in CFTR, the gene encoding the epithelial ion channel that normally transports chloride and bicarbonate, lead to impaired mucus hydration and clearance. Classical cystic fibrosis is thus characterised by chronic pulmonary infection and inflammation, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, male infertility, and might include several comorbidities such as cystic fibrosis-related diabetes or cystic fibrosis liver disease. This autosomal recessive disease is diagnosed in many regions following newborn screening, whereas in other regions, diagnosis is based on a group of recognised multiorgan clinical manifestations, raised sweat chloride concentrations, or CFTR mutations. Disease that is less easily diagnosed, and in some cases affecting only one organ, can be seen in the context of gene variants leading to residual protein function. Management strategies, including augmenting mucociliary clearance and aggressively treating infections, have gradually improved life expectancy for people with cystic fibrosis. However, restoration of CFTR function via new small molecule modulator drugs is transforming the disease for many patients.

Unfortunately, progress towards development of effective therapeutics has been slow, despite notable advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis and considerable investment in antiviral drug discovery. For decades antibody-dependent enhancement has been the prevalent model to explain dengue pathogenesis, but it was only recently demonstrated in vivo and in clinical studies. At present, the current mainstay of management for most symptomatic dengue patients remains careful observation and prompt but judicious use of intravenous hydration therapy for those with substantial vascular leakage. Various new promising technologies for diagnosis of dengue are currently in the pipeline. New sample-in, answer-out nucleic acid amplification technologies for point-of-care use are being developed to improve performance over current technologies, with the potential to test for multiple pathogens using a single specimen. The search for biomarkers that reliably predict development of severe dengue among symptomatic individuals is also a major focus of current research efforts. The first dengue vaccine was licensed in 2015 but its performance depends on serostatus. There is an urgent need to identify correlates of both vaccine protection and disease enhancement. A crucial assessment of vector control tools should guide a research agenda for determining the most effective interventions, and how to best combine state-of-the-art vector control with vaccination.","[Wilder-Smith, Annelies] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London, England; [Wilder-Smith, Annelies] Nanyang Technol Univ, Lee Kong Chian Sch Med, Singapore, Singapore; [Horstick, Olaf; Wills, Bridget] Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg Inst Global Hlth, Heidelberg, Germany; [Ooi, Eng-Eong] Duke Natl Univ, Singapore Med Sch, Singapore, Singapore; [Ooi, Eng-Eong] Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, Singapore, Singapore; [Wills, Bridget] Univ Oxford, Clin Res Unit, Wellcome Trust Asia Programme, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Wills, Bridget] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Med, Ctr Trop Med & Global Hlth, Oxford, England",,"Wilder-Smith, A (corresponding author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Dis Control, London WC1E 7HT, England.",anneliesws@gmail.com,,"Ooi, Eng Eong/0000-0002-0520-1544; Wills, Bridget/0000-0001-9086-8804",,,,,172,228,240,19,105,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,JAN 26,2019,393,10169,,,,,350,363,,10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32560-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32560-1,,,14,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,HI9WK,30696575,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000456808200027,View Full Record in Web of Science,89163,0,27,65,29,116,34,93,162,97,89,19,100,115,87,77,106

Curves progress in approximately two-thirds of patients with AIS before skeletal maturity, and large curves (>50 degrees) may be associated with adverse health outcomes. OBJECTIVE To systematically review evidence on benefits and harms of AIS screening for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). DATA SOURCES Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, ERIC, PubMed, CINAHL, and relevant systematic reviews were searched for studies published from January 1966 to October 20, 2016; studies included in a previous USPSTF report were also reviewed. Surveillance was conducted through July 24, 2017. STUDY SELECTION Fair-and good-quality studies that evaluated the accuracy of screening children and adolescents aged 10 to 18 years for AIS, the benefits of AIS treatment, the harms of AIS screening or treatment, or long-term health outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles and extracted data into evidence tables. Results were qualitatively summarized. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Health outcomes and spinal curvature in adolescence and adulthood, accuracy of screening for AIS, any harm of AIS screening or treatment. RESULTS Fourteen studies (N = 448 276) in 26 articles were included. Accuracy of AIS screening was highest (93.8% sensitivity; 99.2% specificity) in a cohort study of a clinic-based program using forward bend test, scoliometer, and Moire topography screening (n = 306 082); accuracy was lower in cohort studies of 6 programs using fewer modalities (n = 141 161). Four controlled studies (n = 587) found evidence for benefit of bracing on curve progression compared with controls. A randomized clinical trial and a nonrandomized trial of exercise treatment (N = 184) found favorable reductions in Cobb angle of 0.67 degrees to 4.9 degrees in the intervention group compared with increases of 1.38 degrees to 2.8 degrees in the control group. Two cohort studies (n = 339) on long-term outcomes found that braced participants reported more negative treatment experience and body appearance compared with surgically treated or untreated participants. A study that combined a randomized clinical trial and cohort design (n = 242) reported harms of bracing, which included skin problems on the trunk and nonback body pains. There was no evidence on the effect of AIS screening on adult health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Screening can detect AIS. Bracing and possibly exercise treatment can interrupt or slow progression of curvature in adolescence. However, there is little or no evidence on long-term outcomes for AIS treated in adolescence, the association between curvature at skeletal maturity and adult health outcomes, the harms of AIS screening or treatment, or the effect of AIS screening on adult health outcomes.","[Dunn, John; Henrikson, Nora B.; Morrison, Caitlin C.; Blasi, Paula R.; Nguyen, Matt] Kaiser Permanente Washington Hlth Res Inst, Kaiser Permanente Res Affiliates Evidence Based P, Seattle, WA 98101 USA; [Lin, Jennifer S.] Kaiser Permanente Ctr Hlth Res, Kaiser Permanente Res Affiliates Evidence Based P, Portland, OR USA",,"Dunn, J (corresponding author), Kaiser Permanente Washington Hlth Res Inst, 1730 Minor Ave, Seattle, WA 98101 USA.",dunn.jb@ghc.org,"Kehoe, Clare/ABC-7984-2020","Blasi, Paula/0000-0002-7094-706X","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA-290-2012-00015-I-357 EPC4]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA-290-2012-00015-I-357 EPC4, Task Order 6, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the USPSTF.",,56,55,61,1,23,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

By convention, the time of stroke onset is established as the time that the patient was last known to be well (i.e., in a normal or baseline state, as confirmed by medical history). Intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase (a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) improves outcomes in selected patients with acute ischemic stroke when administered within 4.5 hours after onset. Later treatment may improve outcomes in selected patients, with the treatment window extended to 9 hours from onset. Intraarterial catheter-based mechanical thrombectomy of occluded large intracranial arteries improves outcomes in selected patients with acute ischemic stroke when performed up to 24 hours after onset. The benefit of alteplase and mechanical thrombectomy is time-dependent, so assessment and treatment should be instituted rapidly. In selected patients with mild acute ischemic stroke who do not qualify for intravenous thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy, dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin when administered within 24 hours after onset and continuedfor 21 days lowers the risk of recurrent stroke. Treatment for patients with acute ischemic stroke is guided by the time from the onset of stroke, the severity of neurologic deficit, and findings on neuroimaging. Recommended treatments in selected patients include intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase and mechanical thrombectomy.","[Powers, William J.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Neurol, Sch Med, Rm 2133,CB 7025,170 Manning Dr, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 USA",,"Powers, WJ (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Neurol, Sch Med, Rm 2133,CB 7025,170 Manning Dr, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 USA.",powersw@neurology.unc.edu,,"Powers, William/0000-0002-9303-5661",,,,,30,52,54,10,31,MASSACHUSETTS MEDICAL SOC,WALTHAM,"WALTHAM WOODS CENTER, 860 WINTER ST,, WALTHAM, MA 02451-1413 USA",0028-4793,1533-4406,,NEW ENGL J MED,N.

Osteoporotic fractures, particularly hip fractures, are associated with limitations in ambulation, chronic pain and disability, loss of independence, and decreased quality of life, and 21% to 30% of patients who experience a hip fracture die within 1 year. The prevalence of primary osteoporosis (ie, osteoporosis without underlying disease) increases with age and differs by race/ethnicity. With the aging of the US population, the potential preventable burden is likely to increase in future years. OBJECTIVE To update the 2011 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for osteoporosis. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for and treatment of osteoporotic fractures in men and women, as well as risk assessment tools, screening intervals, and efficacy of screening and treatment in subgroups. The screening population was postmenopausal women and older men with no known previous osteoporotic fractures and no known comorbid conditions or medication use associated with secondary osteoporosis. FINDINGS The USPSTF found convincing evidence that bone measurement tests are accurate for detecting osteoporosis and predicting osteoporotic fractures in women and men. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that clinical risk assessment tools are moderately accurate in identifying risk of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that drug therapies reduce subsequent fracture rates in postmenopausal women. The USPSTF found that the evidence is inadequate to assess the effectiveness of drug therapies in reducing subsequent fracture rates in men without previous fractures. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent osteoporotic fractures in women 65 years and older. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years at increased risk of osteoporosis, as determined by a formal clinical risk assessment tool. (B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for osteoporosis to prevent osteoporotic fractures in men.

Importance Bacterial vaginosis is common and is caused by a disruption of the microbiological environment in the lower genital tract. In the US, reported prevalence of bacterial vaginosis among pregnant women ranges from 5.8% to 19.3% and is higher in some races/ethnicities. Bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy has been associated with adverse obstetrical outcomes including preterm delivery, early miscarriage, postpartum endometritis, and low birth weight. Objective To update its 2008 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on the accuracy of screening and the benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant persons to prevent preterm delivery. Population This recommendation applies to pregnant persons without symptoms of bacterial vaginosis. Evidence Assessment The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons not at increased risk for preterm delivery has no net benefit in preventing preterm delivery. The USPSTF concludes that for pregnant persons at increased risk for preterm delivery, the evidence is conflicting and insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. Conclusions and Recommendation The USPSTF recommends against screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons not at increased risk for preterm delivery.

The loss of CSF results in displacement of cerebral structures, causing headache and other neurologic symptoms.(1) The term spontaneous in relation to the disorder is used to differentiate it from intracranial hypotension caused by CSF leaks of known cause, such as craniospinal trauma, spinal surgery, or most commonly, lumbar puncture or spinal anesthesia. Although CSF pressure in this disorder, as measured by manometry during lumbar puncture, may be normal,(2) it is often lower than normal (with the normal value considered to be 6 to 25 cm of water, or 4.4 to 18.4 mm Hg), and the term hypotension continues to be used. Spontaneous intracranial hypotension assumes clinical importance as a treatable cause of headache and other manifestations, including dizziness, mental dullness, and behavioral changes, but the variability in clinical presentation makes diagnosis difficult.(1)","[Schievink, Wouter, I] Cedars Sinai Med Ctr, Dept Neurosurg, 127 S San Vicente Blvd,Ste A6600, Los Angeles, CA 90048 USA",,"Schievink, WI (corresponding author), Cedars Sinai Med Ctr, Dept Neurosurg, 127 S San Vicente Blvd,Ste A6600, Los Angeles, CA 90048 USA.",schievinkw@cshs.org,,,,,,,28,5,5,2,2,MASSACHUSETTS MEDICAL SOC,WALTHAM,"WALTHAM WOODS CENTER, 860 WINTER ST,, WALTHAM, MA 02451-1413 USA",0028-4793,1533-4406,,NEW ENGL J MED,N.

The median age at diagnosis is 62 years, and an estimated 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer at some point in their lifetime. African American women are more likely to die of breast cancer compared with women of other races. OBJECTIVE To update the 2013 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on medications for risk reduction of primary breast cancer. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed evidence on the accuracy of risk assessment methods to identify women who could benefit from risk-reducing medications for breast cancer, as well as evidence on the effectiveness, adverse effects, and subgroup variations of these medications. The USPSTF reviewed evidence from randomized trials, observational studies, and diagnostic accuracy studies of risk stratification models in women without preexisting breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ. FINDINGS The USPSTF found convincing evidence that risk assessment tools can predict the number of cases of breast cancer expected to develop in a population. However, these risk assessment tools perform modestly at best in discriminating between individual women who will or will not develop breast cancer. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that risk-reducing medications (tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors) provide at least a moderate benefit in reducing risk for invasive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer. The USPSTF found that the benefits of taking tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors to reduce risk for breast cancer are no greater than small in women not at increased risk for the disease. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that tamoxifen and raloxifene and adequate evidence that aromatase inhibitors are associated with small to moderate harms. Overall, the USPSTF determined that the net benefit of taking medications to reduce risk of breast cancer is larger in women who have a greater risk for developing breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF recommends that clinicians offer to prescribe risk-reducing medications, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors, to women who are at increased risk for breast cancer and at low risk for adverse medication effects. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against the routine use of risk-reducing medications, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors, in women who are not at increased risk for breast cancer. (D recommendation) This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women 35 years and older, including women with previous benign breast lesions on biopsy (such as atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ). This recommendation does not apply to women who have a current or previous diagnosis of breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ.","[Owens, Douglas K.] Vet Affairs Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Palo Alto, CA USA; [Owens, Douglas K.] Stanford Univ, 616 Serra St,Encina Hall,Room C336, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Davidson, Karina W.] Northwell Hlth, Feinstein Inst Med Res, Manhasset, NY USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Fairfax Family Practice Residency, Fairfax, VA USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, VA USA; [Barry, Michael J.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Cabana, Michael] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Caughey, Aaron B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Doubeni, Chyke A.] Mayo Clin, Rochester, NY USA; [Epling, John W., Jr.] Virginia Tech Carilion Sch Med, Roanoke, VA USA; [Kubik, Martha] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Landefeld, C.

ObjectiveTo examine vital statistics and review the history of changes in US life expectancy and increasing mortality rates; and to identify potential contributing factors, drawing insights from current literature and an analysis of state-level trends. EvidenceLife expectancy data for 1959-2016 and cause-specific mortality rates for 1999-2017 were obtained from the US Mortality Database and CDC WONDER, respectively. The analysis focused on midlife deaths (ages 25-64 years), stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geography (including the 50 states). Published research from January 1990 through August 2019 that examined relevant mortality trends and potential contributory factors was examined. FindingsBetween 1959 and 2016, US life expectancy increased from 69.9 years to 78.9 years but declined for 3 consecutive years after 2014. The recent decrease in US life expectancy culminated a period of increasing cause-specific mortality among adults aged 25 to 64 years that began in the 1990s, ultimately producing an increase in all-cause mortality that began in 2010. During 2010-2017, midlife all-cause mortality rates increased from 328.5 deaths/100000 to 348.2 deaths/100000. By 2014, midlife mortality was increasing across all racial groups, caused by drug overdoses, alcohol abuse, suicides, and a diverse list of organ system diseases. The largest relative increases in midlife mortality rates occurred in New England (New Hampshire, 23.3%; Maine, 20.7%; Vermont, 19.9%) and the Ohio Valley (West Virginia, 23.0%; Ohio, 21.6%; Indiana, 14.8%; Kentucky, 14.7%). The increase in midlife mortality during 2010-2017 was associated with an estimated 33307 excess US deaths, 32.8% of which occurred in 4 Ohio Valley states. Conclusions and RelevanceUS life expectancy increased for most of the past 60 years, but the rate of increase slowed over time and life expectancy decreased after 2014. A major contributor has been an increase in mortality from specific causes (eg, drug overdoses, suicides, organ system diseases) among young and middle-aged adults of all racial groups, with an onset as early as the 1990s and with the largest relative increases occurring in the Ohio Valley and New England.

In pregnant women, lead exposure can impair organ systems such as the hematopoietic, hepatic, renal, and nervous systems, and increase the risk of preeclampsia and adverse perinatal outcomes. Many of the adverse health effects of lead exposure are irreversible. OBJECTIVE To update the 2006 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for elevated blood lead levels in children and pregnant women. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of elevated blood lead levels. In this update, an elevated blood lead level was defined according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reference level of 5 mu g/dL. FINDINGS The USPSTF found adequate evidence that questionnaires and other clinical prediction tools to identify asymptomatic children with elevated blood lead levels are inaccurate. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that capillary blood testing accurately identifies children with elevated blood lead levels. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the effectiveness of treatment of elevated blood lead levels in asymptomatic children 5 years and younger and in pregnant women. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence regarding the accuracy of questionnaires and other clinical prediction tools to identify asymptomatic pregnant women with elevated blood lead levels. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening for or treatment of elevated blood lead levels in asymptomatic children and pregnant women. The USPSTF concluded that the current evidence is insufficient, and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening for elevated blood lead levels in asymptomatic children 5 years and younger and in pregnant women cannot be determined. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for elevated blood lead levels in asymptomatic children.

Findings In this meta-analysis that included 12 trials with 92 135 participants for the primary outcome measure, blood pressure lowering with antihypertensive agents, compared with control, was associated with the development of a composite dementia or cognitive impairment outcome in 7.0% vs 7.5% of patients over a mean trial follow-up of 4.1 years, a difference that was statistically significant. Meaning Lowering blood pressure may be associated with a lower risk of dementia or cognitive impairment. Importance The benefit of blood pressure lowering for the prevention of dementia or cognitive impairment is unclear. Objective To determine the association of blood pressure lowering with dementia or cognitive impairment. Data Sources and Study Selection Search of PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL for randomized clinical trials published from database inception through December 31, 2019, that evaluated the association of blood pressure lowering on cognitive outcomes. The control groups consisted of either placebo, alternative antihypertensive agents, or higher blood pressure targets. Data Extraction and Synthesis Data were screened and extracted independently by 2 authors. Random-effects meta-analysis models were used to report pooled treatment effects and CIs. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was dementia or cognitive impairment. The secondary outcomes were cognitive decline and changes in cognitive test scores. Results Fourteen randomized clinical trials were eligible for inclusion (96 158 participants), of which 12 reported the incidence of dementia (or composite of dementia and cognitive impairment [3 trials]) on follow-up and were included in the primary meta-analysis, 8 reported cognitive decline, and 8 reported changes in cognitive test scores. The mean (SD) age of trial participants was 69 (5.4) years and 40 617 (42.2%) were women. The mean systolic baseline blood pressure was 154 (14.9) mm Hg and the mean diastolic blood pressure was 83.3 (9.9) mm Hg. The mean duration of follow-up was 49.2 months. Blood pressure lowering with antihypertensive agents compared with control was significantly associated with a reduced risk of dementia or cognitive impairment (12 trials; 92 & x202f;135 participants) (7.0% vs 7.5% of patients over a mean trial follow-up of 4.1 years; odds ratio [OR], 0.93 [95% CI, 0.88-0.98]; absolute risk reduction, 0.39% [95% CI, 0.09%-0.68%]; I-2 = 0.0%) and cognitive decline (8 trials) (20.2% vs 21.1% of participants over a mean trial follow-up of 4.1 years; OR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.88-0.99]; absolute risk reduction, 0.71% [95% CI, 0.19%-1.2%]; I-2 = 36.1%). Blood pressure lowering was not significantly associated with a change in cognitive test scores. Conclusions and Relevance In this meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, blood pressure lowering with antihypertensive agents compared with control was significantly associated with a lower risk of incident dementia or cognitive impairment. This systematic review and meta-analysis examines whether blood pressure lowering is associated with a reduced risk of dementia or cognitive impairment.","[Hughes, Diarmaid; Judge, Conor; Murphy, Robert; Loughlin, Elaine; Costello, Maria; O'Donnell, Martin J.; Canavan, Michelle] NUI Galway, HRB Clin Res Facil, NUI Galway, Galway, Ireland; [Hughes, Diarmaid; Judge, Conor; Murphy, Robert; Loughlin, Elaine; Costello, Maria; O'Donnell, Martin J.; Canavan, Michelle] Saolta Univ Hosp Grp, Galway, Ireland; [Judge, Conor] NUI Galway, Translat Med Device Lab, Galway, Ireland; [Judge, Conor] Irish Clin Acad Training, Wellcome Trust HRB, Dublin, Ireland; [Whiteley, William] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Clin Brain Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Bosch, Jackie; O'Donnell, Martin J.] Populat Hlth Res Inst, Hamilton, ON, Canada",,"Canavan, M (corresponding author), Galway Univ Hosp, HRB Clin Res Facil, Newcastle Rd, Galway H91YR7, Ireland.",michelle.canavan@hse.ie,"O'Donnell, Martin/ABE-7459-2020; Bosch, Jackie/AAP-6910-2021; Judge, Conor/L-7422-2018; Bosch, Jackie/N-2816-2013","O'Donnell, Martin/0000-0002-7347-7761; Judge, Conor/0000-0001-9473-2920; Bosch, Jackie/0000-0001-6292-4207; Murphy, Robert P/0000-0001-5446-4175; Whiteley, William/0000-0002-4816-8991",Irish Clinical Academic Training Programme; Wellcome Trust; Health Research Board [203930/B/16/Z]; Health Service Executive; National Doctors Training and Planning; Health and Social Care Research and Development Division Northern Ireland; European Research Council (COSIP) [640580],Irish Clinical Academic Training Programme; Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); Health Research Board; Health Service Executive; National Doctors Training and Planning; Health and Social Care Research and Development Division Northern Ireland; European Research Council (COSIP),"Dr Judge was supported by the Irish Clinical Academic Training Programme, the Wellcome Trust, the Health Research Board (grant number 203930/B/16/Z), the Health Service Executive, National Doctors Training and Planning, and the Health and Social Care Research and Development Division Northern Ireland.

For women in the United States, breast cancer is the most common cancer after nonmelanoma skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death. In the general population, BRCA1/2 mutations occur in an estimated 1 in 300 to 500 women and account for 5% to 10% of breast cancer cases and 15% of ovarian cancer cases. OBJECTIVE To update the 2013 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA-related cancer. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for potentially harmful BRCA1/2 mutations in asymptomatic women who have never been diagnosed with BRCA-related cancer, as well as those with a previous diagnosis of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer who have completed treatment and are considered cancer free. In addition, the USPSTF reviewed interventions to reduce the risk for breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer in women with potentially harmful BRCA1/2 mutations, including intensive cancer screening, medications, and risk-reducing surgery. FINDINGS For women whose family or personal history is associated with an increased risk for harmful mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes, or who have an ancestry associated with BRCA1/2 gene mutations, there is adequate evidence that the benefits of risk assessment, genetic counseling, genetic testing, and interventions are moderate. For women whose personal or family history or ancestry is not associated with an increased risk for harmful mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes, there is adequate evidence that the benefits of risk assessment, genetic counseling, genetic testing, and interventions are small to none. Regardless of family or personal history, the USPSTF found adequate evidence that the overall harms of risk assessment, genetic counseling, genetic testing, and interventions are small to moderate. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians assess women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer or who have an ancestry associated with BRCA1/2 gene mutations with an appropriate brief familial risk assessment tool. Women with a positive result on the risk assessment tool should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, genetic testing. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against routine risk assessment, genetic counseling, or genetic testing for women whose personal or family history or ancestry is not associated with potentially harmful BRCA1/2 gene mutations.

Often, post-marketing research landscape is fragmented. When regulatory agencies require pharmaceutical and device manufacturers to conduct studies in the post-marketing period, these studies might remain incomplete many years after approval. Even when completed, many post-marketing studies lack meaningful active comparators, have observational designs, and might not collect patient-relevant outcomes. Regulators, in collaboration with the industry and patients, ought to ensure that the key questions unanswered at the time of drug and device approval are resolved in a timely fashion during the post-marketing phase. We propose a set of seven key guiding principles that we believe will provide the necessary incentives for pharmaceutical and device manufacturers to generate comparative data in the post-marketing period. First, regulators (for drugs and devices), notified bodies (for devices in Europe), health technology assessment organisations, and payers should develop customised evidence generation plans, ensuring that future post-approval studies address any limitations of the data available at the time of market entry impacting the benefit-risk profiles of drugs and devices. Second, post-marketing studies should be designed hierarchically: priority should be given to efforts aimed at evaluating a product's net clinical benefit in randomised trials compared with current known effective therapy, whenever possible, to address common decisional dilemmas. Third, post-marketing studies should incorporate active comparators as appropriate. Fourth, use of non-randomised studies for the evaluation of clinical benefit in the post-marketing period should be limited to instances when the magnitude of effect is deemed to be large or when it is possible to reasonably infer the comparative benefits or risks in settings, in which doing a randomised trial is not feasible. Fifth, efficiency of randomised trials should be improved by streamlining patient recruitment and data collection through innovative design elements. Sixth, governments should directly support and facilitate the production of comparative post-marketing data by investing in the development of collaborative research networks and data systems that reduce the complexity, cost, and waste of rigorous post-marketing research efforts. Last, financial incentives and penalties should be developed or more actively reinforced.","[Cipriani, Andrea; Tomlinson, Anneka] Univ Oxford, Dept Psychiat, Oxford, England; [Cipriani, Andrea; Tomlinson, Anneka] Warneford Hosp, Oxford Hlth NHS Fdn Trust, Oxford, England; [Ioannidis, John P.

Since 2005, Ethiopia has embraced a diagonal investment approach to strengthen its PHC systems and concurrently scale up DCPs. This approach has led to a substantial improvement in PHC-system capacity that has contributed to increased coverage of DCPs and improved health status, although gaps in equity and quality in health services remain to be addressed. Since 2013, Ethiopia has had a decline in development assistance for health. Nevertheless, the Ethiopian Government has been able to compensate for this decline by increasing domestic resources. We argue that the diagonal investment approach can effectively strengthen PHC systems, achieve DCP targets, and sustain the gains. These goals can be achieved if a visionary and committed leadership coordinates its development partners and mobilises the local community, to ensure financial support to health services and improve population health. The lessons learnt from Ethiopia's efforts to improve its health services indicate that global-health initiatives should have a proactive and balanced investment approach to concurrently strengthen PHC systems, achieve programme targets, and sustain the gains, in resource-poor settings.","[Assefa, Yibeltal; Hill, Peter S.] Univ Queensland, Sch Publ Hlth, Brisbane, Qld 4006, Australia; [Tesfaye, Dessalegn] US Agcy Int Dev, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Van Damme, Wim] Inst Trop Med, Dept Publ Hlth, Antwerp, Belgium",,"Assefa, Y (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Publ Hlth, Brisbane, Qld 4006, Australia.",y.alemu@uq.edu.au,"Hill, Peter Stewart/AAL-8053-2020; Van Damme, Wim/F-7404-2011; Assefa, Yibeltal/ABI-8057-2020; Assefa, Yibeltal/N-5984-2016","Hill, Peter Stewart/0000-0001-7091-5108; Van Damme, Wim/0000-0002-6344-3007; Assefa, Yibeltal/0000-0003-2393-1492; Assefa, Yibeltal/0000-0003-2393-1492",,,,,93,25,26,3,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,OCT 20,2018,392,10156,,,,,1473,1481,,10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32215-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32215-3,,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),General & Internal Medicine,GX5PD,30343861,,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000447800900028,View Full Record in Web of Science,91699,0,15,89,13,33,26,83,7,82,48,87,27,22,89,68,89

Development assistance is an important source of health financing in many low-income countries, yet little is known about how much of this funding was disbursed for COVID-19. We aimed to put development assistance for health for COVID-19 in the context of broader trends in global health financing, and to estimate total health spending from 1995 to 2050 and development assistance for COVID-19 in 2020. Methods We estimated domestic health spending and development assistance for health to generate total health-sector spending estimates for 204 countries and territories. We leveraged data from the WHO Global Health Expenditure Database to produce estimates of domestic health spending. To generate estimates for development assistance for health, we relied on project-level disbursement data from the major international development agencies' online databases and annual financial statements and reports for information on income sources. To adjust our estimates for 2020 to include disbursements related to COVID-19, we extracted project data on commitments and disbursements from a broader set of databases (because not all of the data sources used to estimate the historical series extend to 2020), including the UN Office of Humanitarian Assistance Financial Tracking Service and the International Aid Transparency Initiative. We reported all the historic and future spending estimates in inflation-adjusted 2020 US$, 2020 US$ per capita, purchasing-power parity-adjusted US$ per capita, and as a proportion of gross domestic product. We used various models to generate future health spending to 2050. Findings In 2019, health spending globally reached $8. 8 trillion (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 8.7-8.8) or $1132 (1119-1143) per person. Spending on health varied within and across income groups and geographical regions. Of this total, $40.4 billion (0.5%, 95% UI 0.5-0.5) was development assistance for health provided to low-income and middle-income countries, which made up 24.6% (UI 24.0-25.1) of total spending in low-income countries. We estimate that $54.8 billion in development assistance for health was disbursed in 2020. Of this, $13.7 billion was targeted toward the COVID-19 health response. $12.3 billion was newly committed and $1.4 billion was repurposed from existing health projects. $3.1 billion (22.4%) of the funds focused on country-level coordination and $2.4 billion (17.9%) was for supply chain and logistics. Only $714.4 million (7.7%) of COVID-19 development assistance for health went to Latin America, despite this region reporting 34.3% of total recorded COVID-19 deaths in low-income or middle-income countries in 2020. Spending on health is expected to rise to $1519 (1448-1591) per person in 2050, although spending across countries is expected to remain varied. Interpretation Global health spending is expected to continue to grow, but remain unequally distributed between countries. We estimate that development organisations substantially increased the amount of development assistance for health provided in 2020. Continued efforts are needed to raise sufficient resources to mitigate the pandemic for the most vulnerable, and to help curtail the pandemic for all. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s).

OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacies of SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, and DPP-4 inhibitors on mortality and cardiovascular end points using network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials, and published meta-analyses from inception through October 11, 2017. STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials enrolling participants with type 2 diabetes and a follow-up of at least 12 weeks were included, for which SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, and DPP-4 inhibitors were compared with either each other or placebo or no treatment. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were screened by 1 investigator and extracted in duplicate by 2 investigators. A Bayesian hierarchical network meta-analysis was performed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome: all-cause mortality; secondary outcomes: cardiovascular (CV) mortality, heart failure (HF) events, myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina, and stroke; safety end points: adverse events and hypoglycemia. RESULTS This network meta-analysis of 236 trials randomizing 176 310 participants found SGLT-2 inhibitors (absolute risk difference [RD], -1.0%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.80 [95% credible interval {CrI}, 0.71 to 0.89]) and GLP-1 agonists (absolute RD, -0.6%; HR, 0.88 [95% CrI, 0.81 to 0.94]) were associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality than the control groups. SGLT-2 inhibitors (absolute RD, -0.9%; HR, 0.78 [95% CrI, 0.68 to 0.90]) and GLP-1 agonists (absolute RD, -0.5%; HR, 0.86 [95% CrI, 0.77 to 0.96]) were associated with lower mortality than were DPP-4 inhibitors. DPP-4 inhibitors were not significantly associated with lower all-cause mortality (absolute RD, 0.1%; HR, 1.02 [95% CrI, 0.94 to 1.11]) than were the control groups. SGLT-2 inhibitors (absolute RD, -0.8%; HR, 0.79 [95% CrI, 0.69 to 0.91]) and GLP-1 agonists (absolute RD, -0.5%; HR, 0.85 [95% CrI, 0.77 to 0.94]) were significantly associated with lower CV mortality than were the control groups. SGLT-2 inhibitors were significantly associated with lower rates of HF events (absolute RD, -1.1%; HR, 0.62 [95% CrI, 0.54 to 0.72]) and MI (absolute RD, -0.6%; HR, 0.86 [95% CrI, 0.77 to 0.97]) than were the control groups. GLP-1 agonists were associated with a higher risk of adverse events leading to trial withdrawal than were SGLT-2 inhibitors (absolute RD, 5.8%; HR, 1.80 [95% CrI, 1.44 to 2.25]) and DPP-4 inhibitors (absolute RD, 3.1%; HR, 1.93 [95% CrI, 1.59 to 2.35]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this network meta-analysis, the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 agonists was associated with lower mortality than DPP-4 inhibitors or placebo or no treatment. Use of DPP-4 inhibitors was not associated with lower mortality than placebo or no treatment.","[Zheng, Sean L.; Aghar-Jaffar, Rochan; Oliver, Nick; Meeran, Karim] Imperial Coll Healthcare NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Endocrinol, London, England; [Zheng, Sean L.] Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Cardiol, London, England; [Zheng, Sean L.; Aghar-Jaffar, Rochan; Shun-Shin, Matthew J.; Francis, Darrel; Oliver, Nick; Meeran, Karim] Imperial Coll London, London, England; [Roddick, Alistair J.] Kings Coll London, Fac Life Sci & Med, London, England; [Aghar-Jaffar, Rochan; Oliver, Nick; Meeran, Karim] Imperial Coll London, Div Diabet Endocrinol & Metab, London, England",,"Zheng, SL (corresponding author), Royal Brompton Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Sydney St, London SW3 6NP, England.",sean.zheng@nhs.net,"Kabak, Serdar/I-8113-2018; Zheng, Sean L./J-5998-2019; Oliver, Nick/G-9109-2016","Zheng, Sean L./0000-0002-5762-6392; Oliver, Nick/0000-0003-3525-3633; Shun-Shin, Matthew/0000-0002-1179-0867; Roddick, Alistair/0000-0002-4184-2541",British Heart Foundation [FS/14/27/30752]; British Heart Foundation [FS/10/38/28268] Funding Source: researchfish,British Heart Foundation(British Heart Foundation); British Heart Foundation(British Heart Foundation),Dr Shun-Shin is supported by grant FS/14/27/30752 from the British Heart Foundation.,,35,203,209,6,67,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

In the United States, it is estimated that medication nonadherence is associated with 125 000 deaths, 10% of hospitalizations, and $100 billion in health care services annually. OBSERVATIONS PubMed was searched from January 1, 2000, to September 6, 2018, for English-language randomized clinical trials of interventions to improve medication adherence. Trials of patients younger than 18 years, trials that used self-report as the primary adherence outcome, and trials with follow-up periods less than 6 months were excluded; 49 trials were included. The most common methods of identifying patients at risk for nonadherence were patient self-report, electronic drug monitors (pill bottles), or pharmacy claims data to measure gaps in supply. Patient self-report is the most practical method of identifying nonadherent patients in the context of clinical care but may overestimate adherence compared with objective methods such as electronic drug monitors and pharmacy claims data. Six categories of interventions, and characteristics of successful interventions within each category, were identified: patient education (eg, recurrent and personalized telephone counseling sessions with health educators); medication regimen management (using combination pills to reduce the number of pills patients take daily); clinical pharmacist consultation for chronic disease co-management (including education, increased frequency of disease monitoring via telephone or in-person follow-up visits, and refill reminders); cognitive behavioral therapies (such as motivational interviewing by trained counselors); medication-taking reminders (such as refill reminder calls or use of electronic drug monitors for real-time monitoring and reminding); and incentives to promote adherence (such as reducing co-payments and paying patients and clinicians for achieving disease management goals). The choice of intervention to promote adherence will depend on feasibility and availability within a practice or health system. Successful interventions that are also clinically practical include using combination pills to reduce daily pill burden, clinical pharmacist consultation for disease co-management, and medication-taking reminders such as telephone calls to prompt refills (maximum observed absolute improvements in adherence of 10%, 15%, and 33%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Adherence can be assessed and improved within the context of usual clinical care, but more intensive and costly interventions that have demonstrated success will require additional investments by health systems.","[Kini, Vinay; Ho, P.

Many health conditions can affect male fertility, which underscores the need for a thorough evaluation of patients to identify treatable or reversible lifestyle factors or medical conditions. Although semen analysis remains the cornerstone for evaluating male infertility, advanced diagnostic tests to investigate sperm quality and function have been developed to improve diagnosis and management. The use of assisted reproductive techniques has also substantially improved the ability of couples with infertility to have biological children.

When addressing the cause of underlying disease, the management of cardiogenic shock consists of vasopressors and inotropes; however, these agents can increase myocardial oxygen consumption, impair tissue perfusion, and are frequently ineffective. An alternative approach is to temporarily augment cardiac output using mechanical devices. The use of these devices-known as temporary circulatory support systems-has increased substantially in recent years, despite being expensive, resource intensive, associated with major complications, and lacking high-quality evidence to support their use. This Review summarises the physiological basis underlying the use of temporary circulatory support for cardiogenic shock, reviews the evidence informing indications and contraindications, addresses ethical considerations, and highlights the need for further research.","[Combes, Alain] Sorbonne Univ, Inst Cardiometab & Nutr, Paris, France; [Combes, Alain] Hop Univ Pitie Salpetriere, AP HP, Inst Cardiol, Serv Med Intens Reanimat, F-75013 Paris, France; [Price, Susanna] Royal Brompton Hosp, Adult Intens Care Unit, London, England; [Price, Susanna] Imperial Coll, Natl Heart & Lung Inst, London, England; [Slutsky, Arthur S.] Univ Toronto, Interdept Div Crit Care Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Slutsky, Arthur S.] Univ Toronto, St Michaels Hosp, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Inst, Dept Med,Keenan Ctr Biomed Res, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Brodie, Daniel] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Div Pulm Allergy & Crit Care Med, 630 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Brodie, Daniel] New York Presbyterian Hosp, Ctr Acute Resp Failure, New York, NY USA",,"Combes, A (corresponding author), Hop Univ Pitie Salpetriere, AP HP, Inst Cardiol, Serv Med Intens Reanimat, F-75013 Paris, France.",alain.combes@aphp.fr,"Slutsky, Arthur/M-3325-2019; Price, Susanna/AAH-7515-2021",,,,,,153,41,44,3,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,JUL 18,2020,396,10245,,,,,199,212,,10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31047-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31047-3,,,14,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,MN8IK,32682486,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2022-07-11,WOS:000551085400020,View Full Record in Web of Science,92133,0,120,64,102,147,27,32,100,109,94,12,14,123,126,148,153

One of its main metabolic complications is type 2 diabetes, as the two conditions share key pathophysiological mechanisms. Weight loss is known to reverse the underlying metabolic abnormalities of type 2 diabetes and, as such, improve glucose control; loss of 15% or more of bodyweight can have a disease-modifying effect in people with type 2 diabetes, an outcome that is not attainable by any other glucose-lowering intervention. Furthermore, weight loss in this population exerts benefits that extend beyond glycaemic control to improve risk factors for cardiometabolic disease and quality of life. We review the evidence supporting the role of weight loss in the management of type 2 diabetes and propose that many patients with type 2 diabetes would benefit from having a primary weight-centric approach to diabetes treatment.

Diagnosis depends on clinical features and brain imaging to differentiate between ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage. Non-contrast CT can exclude haemorrhage, but the addition of CT perfusion imaging and angiography allows a positive diagnosis of ischaemic stroke versus mimics and can identify a large vessel occlusion target for endovascular thrombectomy. Management of ischaemic stroke has greatly advanced, with rapid reperfusion by use of intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy shown to reduce disability. These therapies can now be applied in selected patients who present late to medical care if there is imaging evidence of salvageable brain tissue. Both haemostatic agents and surgical interventions are investigational for intracerebral haemorrhage. Prevention of recurrent stroke requires an understanding of the mechanism of stroke to target interventions, such as carotid endarterectomy, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, and patent foramen ovale closure. However, interventions such as lowering blood pressure, smoking cessation, and lifestyle optimisation are common to all stroke subtypes.","[Campbell, Bruce C.

OBJECTIVE To provide updated model-based estimates of the net balance in benefits and harms from routine use of low-dose aspirin for primary prevention. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Microsimulation modeling was used to estimate long-term benefits and harms for hypothetical US cohorts of men and women aged 40 to 79 years with up to 20% 10-year risk for an atherosclerotic CVD event and without prior history of CVD or elevated bleeding risks. EXPOSURES Low-dose (<= 100 mg/d) aspirin for lifetime use, unless contraindicated by a bleeding event, and with stopping ages in 5-year intervals from age 65 to 85 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were lifetime net benefits measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and life-years. Benefits included reduced nonfatal myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Harms included increased nonfatal major gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage. Reduced CRC incidence was considered in sensitivity analysis. RESULTS Estimated lifetime net QALYs were positive for both men and women at 5% or greater 10-year CVD risk when starting between ages 40 and 59 years and at 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk when starting between ages 60 and 69 years. These estimates ranged from 2.3 (95% CI, -2.7 to 7.4) to 66.2 (95% CI, 58.2 to 74.1) QALYs per 1000 persons. Lifetime net life-years were positive for men at 5% or greater and women at 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk starting aspirin at ages 40 to 49 years and for men at 7.5% or greater and women at 15% or greater 10-year CVD risk at ages 50 to 59 years. These estimates ranged from 0.4 (95% CI, -6.1 to 6.9) to 52.4 (95% CI, 43.9 to 60.9) life-years per 1000 persons. Lifetime net life-years were negative in most cases for persons starting aspirin between ages 60 and 79 years, as were lifetime net QALYs for persons aged 70 to 79 years. Stopping aspirin between ages 65 and 85 years generally showed little advantage compared with lifetime use. Sensitivity analyses showed lifetime net benefits may be higher if aspirin reduced CRC incidence or CVD mortality and lower if aspirin increased fatal major gastrointestinal bleeding or reduced quality of life with routine use.

Characteristic imaging findings include pancreatic stones, dilated ducts, and atrophy. Complications of chronic pancreatitis include pseudocysts, biliary strictures, exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency, bone loss, and pancreatic cancer; there is currently no effective early detection strategy for pancreatic cancer. Exocrine insufficiency causing steatorrhea leads to weight loss, sarcopenia, and deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins and other micronutrients and is mitigated by treatment with pancreatic-enzyme replacement. Strategies for managing chronic abdominal pain include medical therapies (analgesic agents, limited use of narcotics, antioxidants, and neuromodulators), endoscopic treatment (pancreatic stenting with or without extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy), and surgical interventions (duct drainage and resection procedures), as well as behavioral interventions for centrally mediated pain. Chronic Pancreatitis Chronic pancreatitis, often associated with alcohol use, smoking, or genetic risk factors, may be complicated by pseudocysts, biliary strictures, pancreatic insufficiency, bone loss, and pancreatic cancer.

New direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens are available. Objective To update the 2013 review on HCV screening to inform the USPSTF. Data Sources Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews through February 2019, with surveillance through September 2019. Study Selection Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized treatment studies of HCV screening and DAA therapy; cohort studies on screening, antiviral therapy, and the association between an SVR after antiviral therapy and clinical outcomes. Data Extraction and Synthesis One investigator abstracted data; a second checked accuracy. Two investigators independently rated study quality. Main Outcomes and Measures Mortality, morbidity, quality of life, screening and treatment harms, and screening diagnostic yield. Results Eight RCTs of DAA therapy vs placebo or an outdated antiviral regimen, 48 other treatment studies, and 33 cohort studies, with a total of 179 & x202f;230 participants, were included. No study evaluated effects of HCV screening vs no screening. One new study since the 2013 review (n = 5917) found similar diagnostic yield of risk-based screening (sensitivity, 82%; number needed to screen to identify 1 HCV case, 15) and birth cohort screening (sensitivity, 76%; number needed to screen, 29), assuming perfect implementation. Ten open-label studies (n = 3292) reported small improvements in some quality-of-life and functional outcomes (eg, less than 3 points on the 0 to 100 36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical and mental component summary scales) after DAA treatment compared with before treatment. Two cohort studies (n = 24 & x202f;686) found inconsistent associations of antiviral therapy vs no therapy with risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Forty-nine treatment studies (n = 10 & x202f;181) found DAA regimens associated with pooled SVR rates greater than 95% across genotypes, and low short-term rates of serious adverse events (1.9%) and withdrawal due to adverse events (0.4%). An SVR after antiviral therapy was associated with decreased adjusted risk of all-cause mortality (13 studies, n = 36 & x202f;986; pooled hazard ratio [HR], 0.40 [95% CI, 0.28-0.56) and hepatocellular carcinoma (20 studies, n = 84 & x202f;491; pooled HR, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.23 to 0.38]) vs no SVR. Conclusions and Relevance Direct evidence on the effects of HCV screening on clinical outcomes remains unavailable, but DAA regimens were associated with SVR rates greater than 95% and few short-term harms relative to older antiviral therapies. An SVR after antiviral therapy was associated with improved clinical outcomes compared with no SVR. This systematic review to support the 2020 US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement on screening for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection summarizes published evidence on the benefits and harms of HCV screening and treatment in adolescents and adults.","[Chou, Roger; Dana, Tracy; Fu, Rongwei; Zakher, Bernadette; Wagner, Jesse; Ramirez, Shaun; Grusing, Sara; Jou, Janice H.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Med Informat & Clin Epidemiol, Northwest Evidence Based Practice Ctr, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Chou, Roger] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Div Gen Internal Med & Geriatr, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Fu, Rongwei] Portland State Univ, Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [Jou, Janice H.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Portland, OR 97201 USA",,"Chou, R (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Pk Rd, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",chour@ohsu.edu,,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA290201500009i]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA290201500009i, Task Order 7, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).",,115,31,31,0,4,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

This review provides an update on the diagnosis and treatment of OSA. Observations The most common presenting symptom of OSA is excessive sleepiness, although this symptom is reported by as few as 15% to 50% of people with OSA in the general population. OSA is associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disease. In many patients, OSA can be diagnosed with home sleep apnea testing, which has a sensitivity of approximately 80%. Effective treatments include weight loss and exercise, positive airway pressure, oral appliances that hold the jaw forward during sleep, and surgical modification of the pharyngeal soft tissues or facial skeleton to enlarge the upper airway. Hypoglossal nerve stimulation is effective in select patients with a body mass index less than 32. There are currently no effective pharmacological therapies. Treatment with positive airway pressure lowers blood pressure, especially in patients with resistant hypertension; however, randomized clinical trials of OSA treatment have not demonstrated significant benefit on rates of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events. Conclusions and Relevance OSA is common and the prevalence is increasing with the increased prevalence of obesity. Daytime sleepiness is among the most common symptoms, but many patients with OSA are asymptomatic. Patients with OSA who are asymptomatic, or whose symptoms are minimally bothersome and pose no apparent risk to driving safety, can be treated with behavioral measures, such as weight loss and exercise. Interventions such as positive airway pressure are recommended for those with excessive sleepiness and resistant hypertension. Managing asymptomatic OSA to reduce cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events is not currently supported by high-quality evidence. This review provides an update on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of obstructive sleep apnea, including the incorporation of questions regarding snoring, breathing pauses at night, and excessive fatigue or sleepiness during the day at routine clinician visits and the increased use of home sleep apnea testing rather than in-hospital testing for diagnostic purposes.","[Gottlieb, Daniel J.] VA Boston Healthcare Syst, Med Serv, Boston, MA USA; [Gottlieb, Daniel J.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Med, Div Sleep & Circadian Disorders, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gottlieb, Daniel J.] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Neurol, Div Sleep & Circadian Disorders, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Gottlieb, Daniel J.] Harvard Med Sch, Div Sleep Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Punjabi, Naresh M.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Div Pulm & Crit Care Med, Baltimore, MD USA",,"Gottlieb, DJ (corresponding author), VA Boston Healthcare Syst, 1400 VFW Pkwy 111PI, West Roxbury, MA 02132 USA.",djgottlieb@partners.org,"Punjabi, Naresh/EMH-1007-2022",,"National Institutes of Health [HL137234, DK120051, NR018335, HL11716, HL146709]; US Department of Veterans Affairs [CX000578, BX004821]",National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); US Department of Veterans Affairs(US Department of Veterans Affairs),"Dr Gottlieb is supported by National Institutes of Health grants HL137234, DK120051, and NR018335 and by US Department of Veterans Affairs grants CX000578 and BX004821.

Unlike acute pain, which carries survival value, chronic pain might be best considered to be a disease, with treatment (eg, to be active despite the pain) and psychological (eg, pain acceptance and optimism as goals) implications. Pain can be categorised as nociceptive (from tissue injury), neuropathic (from nerve injury), or nociplastic (from a sensitised nervous system), all of which affect work-up and treatment decisions at every level; however, in practice there is considerable overlap in the different types of pain mechanisms within and between patients, so many experts consider pain classification as a continuum. The biopsychosocial model of pain presents physical symptoms as the denouement of a dynamic interaction between biological, psychological, and social factors. Although it is widely known that pain can cause psychological distress and sleep problems, many medical practitioners do not realise that these associations are bidirectional. While predisposing factors and consequences of chronic pain are well known, the flipside is that factors promoting resilience, such as emotional support systems and good health, can promote healing and reduce pain chronification.

Despite this, in-hospital cardiac arrest has received little attention compared with other high-risk cardiovascular conditions, such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. OBSERVATIONS In-hospital cardiac arrest occurs in over 290 000 adults each year in the United States. Cohort data from the United States indicate that the mean age of patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest is 66 years, 58% are men, and the presenting rhythm is most often (81%) nonshockable (ie, asystole or pulseless electrical activity). The cause of the cardiac arrest is most often cardiac (50%-60%), followed by respiratory insufficiency (15%-40%). Efforts to prevent in-hospital cardiac arrest require both a system for identifying deteriorating patients and an appropriate interventional response (eg, rapid response teams). The key elements of treatment during cardiac arrest include chest compressions, ventilation, early defibrillation, when applicable, and immediate attention to potentially reversible causes, such as hyperkalemia or hypoxia. There is limited evidence to support more advanced treatments. Post-cardiac arrest care is focused on identification and treatment of the underlying cause, hemodynamic and respiratory support, and potentially employing neuroprotective strategies (eg, targeted temperature management). Although multiple individual factors are associated with outcomes (eg, age, initial rhythm, duration of the cardiac arrest), a multifaceted approach considering both potential for neurological recovery and ongoing multiorgan failure is warranted for prognostication and clinical decision-making in the post-cardiac arrest period. Withdrawal of care in the absence of definite prognostic signs both during and after cardiac arrest should be avoided. Hospitals are encouraged to participate in national quality-improvement initiatives. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE An estimated 290 000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur each year in the United States. However, there is limited evidence to support clinical decision making. An increased awareness with regard to optimizing clinical care and new research might improve outcomes.","[Andersen, Lars W.; Holmberg, Mathias J.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Clin Med, Res Ctr Emergency Med, Palle Juul Jensens Blvd 99,Bygning J, DK-8200 Aarhus N, Denmark; [Andersen, Lars W.; Holmberg, Mathias J.; Berg, Katherine M.; Donnino, Michael W.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Emergency Med, Ctr Resuscitat Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Andersen, Lars W.] Randers Reg Hosp, Dept Intens Care Med, Randers, Denmark; [Berg, Katherine M.; Donnino, Michael W.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Pulm & Crit Care Med, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Granfeldt, Asger] Aarhus Univ Hosp, Dept Intens Care, Aarhus, Denmark",,"Andersen, LW (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Clin Med, Res Ctr Emergency Med, Palle Juul Jensens Blvd 99,Bygning J, DK-8200 Aarhus N, Denmark.",lwandersen@clin.au.dk,,"Andersen, Lars Wiuff/0000-0001-5752-8082; Holmberg, Mathias Johan/0000-0001-5816-337X; Granfeldt, Asger/0000-0002-7241-6131","NHLBI NIH HHS [K23 HL128814, R01 HL136705, K24 HL127101] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE [K24HL127101, K23HL128814, R01HL136705] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","NHLBI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI)); NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI))",,,110,245,266,4,38,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

It is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, which was identified in the first decade of the 20th century. Once acute infection resolves, patients can develop chronic disease, which in up to 30-40% of cases is characterised by cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, megaviscera, and, more rarely, polyneuropathy and stroke. Even after more than a century, many challenges remain unresolved, since epidemiological control and diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic methods must be improved. In particular, the efficacy and tolerability profile of therapeutic agents is far from ideal. Furthermore, the population affected is older and more complex (eg, immunosuppressed patients and patients with cancer). Nevertheless, in recent years, our knowledge of Chagas disease has expanded, and the international networking needed to change the course of this deadly disease during the 21st century has begun.","[Perez-Molina, Jose A.] Hosp Univ Ramon & Cajal, Dept Infect Dis, Natl Referral Ctr Trop Dis, Inst Ramon & Cajal Invest Sanitaria, Madrid, Spain; [Molina, Israel] Hosp Univ Vall dHebron, Dept Infect Dis, Barcelona, Spain; [Molina, Israel] Catalan Inst Hlth, Int Hlth Program, Barcelona, Spain",,"Perez-Molina, JA (corresponding author), Hosp Univ Ramon & Cajal, Dept Infect Dis, Natl Referral Ctr Trop Dis, Madrid 28034, Spain.",jperezm@salud.madrid.org,,"Molina Romero, Israel/0000-0001-6642-7515; Perez-Molina, Jose Antonio/0000-0001-8735-4124","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad; Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Subdireccion General de Redes; Network Biomedical Research on Tropical Diseases (RICET) [RD16/0027/0020]","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Subdireccion General de Redes; Network Biomedical Research on Tropical Diseases (RICET)","Funding was provided by Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad; Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Subdireccion General de Redes; Network Biomedical Research on Tropical Diseases (RICET) (ref RD16/0027/0020).",,142,536,550,3,89,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,JAN 6,2018,391,10115,,,,,82,94,,10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31612-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31612-4,,,13,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,FR9ZB,28673423,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000419432300032,View Full Record in Web of Science,93895,0,140,81,121,75,34,142,1,128,116,75,131,62,65,90,137

Understanding of the underlying mechanisms, including the interplay between beta-cell failure, insulin sensitivity, appetite regulation, and adipose storage has been facilitated by the integration of multidimensional data for diabetes-related intermediate phenotypes, detailed genomic annotations, functional experiments, and now multiomic molecular features. Studies in diverse ethnic groups and examples from population isolates have shown the value and need for a broad genomic approach to this global disease. Transethnic discovery efforts and large-scale biobanks in diverse populations and ancestries could help to address some of the Eurocentric bias. Despite rapid progress in the discovery of the highly polygenic architecture of type 2 diabetes, dominated by common alleles with small, cumulative effects on disease risk, these insights have been of little clinical use in terms of disease prediction or prevention, and have made only small contributions to subtype classification or stratified approaches to treatment. Successful development of academia-industry partnerships for exome or genome sequencing in large biobanks could help to deliver economies of scale, with implications for the future of genomics-focused research.","[Langenberg, Claudia; Lotta, Luca A.] Univ Cambridge, MRC Epidemiol Unit, Cambridge, England",,"Langenberg, C (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, MRC Epidemiol Unit, Inst Metab Sci, Box 285,Cambridge Biomed Campus, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, England.",claudia.langenberg@mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk,"Langenberg, Claudia/ABG-9067-2021","Langenberg, Claudia/0000-0002-5017-7344",MRC [MC_UU_12015/1] Funding Source: UKRI,MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),,,148,60,64,5,35,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,JUN 16,2018,391,10138,,,,,2463,2474,,10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31132-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31132-2,,,12,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,GK7QC,29916387,Green Submitted,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000436402000030,View Full Record in Web of Science,94199,0,58,29,57,92,64,54,14,81,15,97,14,132,111,25,38

OBSERVATIONS Both genetic and environmental factors are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of CP. Environmental factors associated with CP include alcohol abuse (odds ratio [OR], 3.1; 95% CI, 1.87-5.14) for 5 or more drinks per day vs abstainers and light drinkers as well as smoking (OR, 4.59; 95% CI, 2.91-7.25) for more than 35 pack-years in a case-control study involving 971 participants. Between 28% to 80% of patients are classified as having idiopathic CP. Up to 50% of these individuals have mutations of the trypsin inhibitor gene (SPINK1) or the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Approximately 1% of people diagnosed with CP may have hereditary pancreatitis, associated with cationic trypsinogen (PRSS1) gene mutations. Approximately 80% of people with CP present with recurrent or chronic upper abdominal pain. Long-term sequelae include diabetes in 38% to 40% and exocrine insufficiency in 30% to 48%. The diagnosis is based on pancreatic calcifications, ductal dilatation, and atrophy visualized by imaging with computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or both. Endoscopic ultrasound can assist in making the diagnosis in patients with a high index of suspicion such as recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis when imaging is normal or equivocal. The first line of therapy consists of advice to discontinue use of alcohol and smoking and taking analgesic agents (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and weak opioids such as tramadol). A trial of pancreatic enzymes and antioxidants (a combination of multivitamins, selenium, and methionine) can control symptoms in up to 50% of patients. Patients with pancreatic ductal obstruction due to stones, stricture, or both may benefit from ductal drainage via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or surgical drainage procedures, such as pancreaticojejunostomy with or without pancreatic head resection, which may provide better pain relief among people who do not respond to endoscopic therapy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Chronic pancreatitis often results in chronic abdominal pain and is most commonly caused by excessive alcohol use, smoking, or genetic mutations. Treatment consists primarily of alcohol and smoking cessation, pain control, replacement of pancreatic insufficiency, or mechanical drainage of obstructed pancreatic ducts for some patients.","[Singh, Vikesh K.] Johns Hopkins Med Inst, Dept Med, Div Gastroenterol, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Yadav, Dhiraj] Univ Pittsburgh, Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Garg, Pramod K.] All India Inst Med Sci, Dept Gastroenterol, New Delhi, India",,"Singh, VK (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Div Gastroenterol, 1830 E Monument St,Room 428, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA.",vsingh1@jhmil.edu,,"Garg, Pramod Kumar/0000-0001-7015-4396",National Cancer Institute; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [UO1 DK 108306]; Center for Advanced Research and Excellence in Pancreatic Diseases by the Indian Council of Medical Research,National Cancer Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)); Center for Advanced Research and Excellence in Pancreatic Diseases by the Indian Council of Medical Research,"Dr Singh reports receiving personal fees from Abbvie, Theraly Inc, Cook Medical, Orgenesis, and Ariel Precision Medicine.

In 2017, more than 2 million people had alcohol-associated cirrhosis in the US. Alcohol-associated liver disease is the primary cause of liver-related mortality and the leading indication for liver transplant, representing 40% to 50% of all liver transplant in high-income countries. OBSERVATIONS Steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis, and fibrosis are the 3 pathologic findings that are associated with progression to cirrhosis, with highest risk in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. The amount and duration of alcohol consumption, female sex, obesity, and specific genetic polymorphisms such as patatin-like phospholipase domain protein 3, membrane bound O-acyltransferase, and transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 genes are risk factors for alcohol-associated liver disease progression. Ten-year survival of patients with alcohol-associated liver disease is 88% among those who are abstinent and 73% for those who relapse to alcohol consumption. Symptomatic alcoholic hepatitis is characterized by rapid onset of jaundice and a 30% risk of mortality 1 year after diagnosis. Severe alcoholic hepatitis, defined as a modified discriminant function score greater than or equal to 32 or Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score (starts at 6 and capped at 40; worst = 40) greater than 20, is associated with the development of acute-on-chronic liver failure and multiorgan failure. Corticosteroid therapy is associated with improved 1-month survival from 65% in untreated patients to 80% in treated patients. Early liver transplant may be appropriate in highly select patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis who do not respond to medical therapy. In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, liver transplant should be considered if the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score remains greater than 17 after 3 months of alcohol abstinence. Between 2014 and 2019, the proportion of patients waiting for liver transplantation who had alcohol-associated liver disease increased from 22% to 40%. Alcohol-associated cirrhosis accounted for approximately 27% of 1.32 million deaths worldwide related to cirrhosis in 2017. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Alcohol-associated liver disease is among the most common liver diseases and more than 2 million people in the US in 2017 had alcohol-associated cirrhosis. Corticosteroid therapy improves survival in select patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. Liver transplantation is the most effective therapy in patients with decompensated liver disease.","[Singal, Ashwani K.] Univ South Dakota, Sanford Sch Med, 1815 S Cliff Ave, Sioux Falls, SD 57105 USA; [Singal, Ashwani K.] Avera Transplant Inst, Sioux Falls, SD USA; [Mathurin, Philippe] Hosp Huriez, Div Hepatol, Lille, France",,"Singal, AK (corresponding author), Univ South Dakota, Sanford Sch Med, 1815 S Cliff Ave, Sioux Falls, SD 57105 USA.;Mathurin, P (corresponding author), Hosp Huriez, Rue Michel Polonowski, F-59000 Lille, France.",philippe.mathurin@chru-lille.fr,"Singal, Ashwani/H-6181-2019","Singal, Ashwani/0000-0003-1207-3998",,,,,98,21,21,6,15,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Diagnosis is primarily based on clinical phenotype because of the diversity of the associated features, which can include skin and nail disease, dactylitis, uveitis, and osteitis. Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis has led to the development of effective biologics and small-molecular drugs targeting specific cytokines and signalling pathways, which can prevent disease progression and improve quality of life. However, at least 40% of patients with psoriatic arthritis have only a partial response or fail to respond to such treatments. Cytokine inhibitors, mainly those specific for tumour necrosis factor and, more recently, the interleukin 23-T-helper-17 cell pathway, have been highly successful in the treatment of disease manifestations in several different tissues, although targeting the interleukin 23-T-helper-17 cell pathway might be more effective in psoriasis than in arthritis. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis-which include genetics, environmental factors, and immune-mediated inflammation-are complex, and the relationship between disease of the joint and that of other domains is poorly understood. Improving our understanding of psoriatic arthritis pathogenesis could help to establish validated biomarkers for diagnosis, predict therapeutic response and remission, develop precision medicines, and predict which patients will respond to which therapy. We discuss advances in pathogenetic translational research that could inform these issues.","[Veale, Douglas J.; Fearon, Ursula] St Vincents Univ Hosp, Rheumatol EULAR Ctr Excellence, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Veale, Douglas J.; Fearon, Ursula] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Fearon, Ursula] Trinity Coll Dublin, Trinity Biomed Sci Inst, Dept Mol Rheumatol, Dublin, Ireland",,"Veale, DJ (corresponding author), St Vincents Univ Hosp, Rheumatol EULAR Ctr Excellence, Dublin 4, Ireland.",douglas.veale@ucd.ie,,"Veale, Douglas/0000-0003-2802-4971; Fearon, Ursula/0000-0001-8084-0429",AbbVie; Janssen; MSD; Novartis; Pfizer; Roche,AbbVie(AbbVie); Janssen(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc); MSD; Novartis(Novartis); Pfizer(Pfizer); Roche(Roche Holding),"DJV has advised, consulted, or participated as a speaker for AbbVie, Actelion, BMS, Celgene, Novartis, Pfizer, MSD, Mundipharma, Roche, and Regeneron and Sanofi.

OBJECTIVE To develop the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) diagnostic test accuracy guideline as a stand-alone extension of the PRISMA statement. Modifications to the PRISMA statement reflect the specific requirements for reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of diagnostic test accuracy studies and the abstracts for these reviews. DESIGN Established standards from the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) Network were followed for the development of the guideline. The original PRISMA statement was used as a framework on which to modify and add items. A group of 24 multidisciplinary experts used a systematic review of articles on existing reporting guidelines and methods, a 3-round Delphi process, a consensus meeting, pilot testing, and iterative refinement to develop the PRISMA diagnostic test accuracy guideline. The final version of the PRISMA diagnostic test accuracy guideline checklist was approved by the group. FINDINGS The systematic review (produced 64 items) and the Delphi process (provided feedback on 7 proposed items; 1 item was later split into 2 items) identified 71 potentially relevant items for consideration. The Delphi process reduced these to 60 items that were discussed at the consensus meeting. Following the meeting, pilot testing and iterative feedback were used to generate the 27-item PRISMA diagnostic test accuracy checklist. To reflect specific or optimal contemporary systematic review methods for diagnostic test accuracy, 8 of the 27 original PRISMA items were left unchanged, 17 were modified, 2 were added, and 2 were omitted. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The 27-item PRISMA diagnostic test accuracy checklist provides specific guidance for reporting of systematic reviews. The PRISMA diagnostic test accuracy guideline can facilitate the transparent reporting of reviews, and may assist in the evaluation of validity and applicability, enhance replicability of reviews, and make the results from systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy studies more useful.","[McInnes, Matthew D.

It is associated with several important medical conditions, including depression, psoriatic arthritis, and cardiometabolic syndrome. Its most common form, chronic plaque or psoriasis vulgaris, is a consequence of genetic susceptibility, particularly in the presence of the HLA-C*06:02 risk allele, and of environmental triggers such as streptococcal infection, stress, smoking, obesity, and alcohol consumption. There are several phenotypes and research has separated pustular from chronic plaque forms. Immunological and genetic studies have identified IL-17 and IL-23 as key drivers of psoriasis pathogenesis. Immune targeting of these cytoldnes and of TNF alpha by biological therapies has revolutionised the care of severe chronic plaque disease. Psoriasis cannot currently be cured, but management should aim to minimise physical and psychological harm by treating patients early in the disease process, identifying and preventing associated multimorbidity, instilling lifestyle modifications, and employing a personalised approach to treatment.","[Griffiths, Christopher E.

The COVID-19 pandemic has crippled health systems, exacerbated household food insecurity, and reversed economic growth, which together could set back improvements in undernutrition across low-income and middle-income countries. This paper highlights how the evidence base for nutrition, health, food systems, social protection, and water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions has evolved since the 2013 Lancet Series on maternal and child nutrition and identifies the priority actions needed to regain and accelerate progress within the next decade. Policies and interventions targeting the first 1000 days of life, including some newly identified since 2013, require renewed commitment, implementation research, and increased funding from both domestic and global actors. A new body of evidence from national and state-level success stories in stunting reduction reinforces the crucial importance of multisectoral actions to address the underlying determinants of undernutrition and identifies key features of enabling political environments. To support these actions, well-resourced nutrition data and information systems are essential. The paper concludes with a call to action for the 2021 Nutrition for Growth Summit to unite global and national nutrition stakeholders around common priorities to tackle a large, unfinished undernutrition agenda-now amplified by the COVID-19 crisis.","[Heidkamp, Rebecca A.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Piwoz, Ellen] Bill & Melinda Gates Fdn, Seattle, WA USA; [Gillespie, Stuart; Ruel, Marie T.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Keats, Emily C.; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.] Hosp Sick Children, Ctr Global Child Hlth, Toronto, ON M5G 0A4, Canada; [D'Alimonte, Mary R.; Flory, Augustin; Clift, Jack W.] Results Dev, Washington, DC USA; [Das, Jai K.] Aga Khan Univ, Div Women & Child Hlth, Karachi, Pakistan; [Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.] Aga Khan Univ, Ctr Excellence Women & Child Hlth, Karachi 74800, Pakistan; [Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.] Aga Khan Univ, Inst Global Hlth & Dev, Karachi 74800, Pakistan; [Menon, Purnima] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Delhi, India; [Vosti, Stephen] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Vosti, Stephen] Univ Calif Davis, Inst Global Nutr, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Akuoku, Jonathan Kweku] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",,"Bhutta, ZA (corresponding author), Hosp Sick Children, Ctr Global Child Hlth, Toronto, ON M5G 0A4, Canada.;Bhutta, ZA (corresponding author), Aga Khan Univ, Ctr Excellence Women & Child Hlth, Karachi 74800, Pakistan.;Bhutta, ZA (corresponding author), Aga Khan Univ, Inst Global Hlth & Dev, Karachi 74800, Pakistan.",zulfiqar.bhutta@aku.edu,"Bhutta, Zulfiqar/L-7822-2015","Bhutta, Zulfiqar/0000-0003-0637-599X",Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1174256],Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationCGIAR),"We thank the many individuals who supported the writing of this manuscript.

Observations A clinical practice guideline is a published statement that includes recommendations that are intended to optimize patient care. In the guideline development process, a panel of experts formulates recommendation questions that guide the retrieval of evidence that is used to inform the recommendations. Typically, methods of guideline development, a summary of the supporting evidence, and a justification of the panel's decisions accompany the recommendations. To use such guidelines optimally, clinicians must understand the implications of the recommendations, assess the trustworthiness of the development process, and evaluate the extent to which the recommendations are applicable to patients in their practice settings. Helpful recommendations are clear and actionable, and explicitly specify whether they are strong or weak, are appropriate for all patients, or depend on individual patients' circumstances and values. Rigorous guidelines and recommendations are informed by appropriately conducted, up-to-date systematic reviews that consider outcomes important to patients. Because judgments are involved in the interpretation of the evidence and the process of moving from evidence to recommendations, useful guidelines consider all relevant factors that have a bearing in a clinical decision and are not influenced by conflicts of interest. Conclusions and Relevance In considering a guideline's recommendations, clinicians must decide whether there are important differences between the factors the guideline panel has considered in making recommendations and their own practice setting. This Users' Guide to the Medical Literature provides suggestions for understanding guideline methods and recommendations for clinicians seeking direction in evaluating clinical practice guidelines for potential use in their practice.","[Brignardello-Petersen, Romina; Guyatt, Gordon H.] McMaster Univ, Dept Hlth Res Methods Evidence & Impact, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Carrasco-Labra, Alonso] Amer Dent Assoc, Dept Evidence Synth & Translat Res, Chicago, IL USA; [Carrasco-Labra, Alonso] Univ N Carolina, Dept Oral & Craniofacial Hlth Sci, Sch Dent, Chapel Hill, NC USA",,"Brignardello-Petersen, R (corresponding author), 1280 Main St W,HSC-2C, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada.",brignarr@mcmaster.ca,,"Carrasco-Labra, Alonso/0000-0003-3546-3526",,,,,36,4,3,1,3,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

We identified the burden of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity, and the risk factors following caesarean sections in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched electronic databases including MEDLINE and Embase (from Jan 1, 1990, to Nov 20, 2017), without language restrictions, for studies on maternal or perinatal outcomes following caesarean sections in LMICs. We excluded studies in high-income countries, those involving non-pregnant women, case reports, and studies published before 1990. Two reviewers undertook the study selection, quality assessment, and data extraction independently. The main outcome being assessed was prevalence of maternal mortality in women undergoing caesarean sections in LMICs. We used a random effects model to synthesise the rate data, and reported the association between risk factors and outcomes using odds ratios with 95% CIs. The study protocol has been registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42015029191. Findings We included 196 studies from 67 LMICs. The risk of maternal death in women who had a caesarean section (116 studies, 2 933 457 caesarean sections) was 7 . 6 per 1000 procedures (95% CI 6 . 6-8 . 6, tau(2) = 0 . 81); the highest burden was in sub-Saharan Africa (10 . 9 per 1000; 9 . 5-12 . 5, tau(2) = 0 . 81).

Given time, all knee replacements will fail and knowing when this failure might happen is important. We aimed to establish how long a knee replacement lasts. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE and Embase for case series and cohort studies published from database inception until July 21, 2018. Articles reporting 15 year or greater survival of primary total knee replacement (TKR), unicondylar knee replacement (UKR), and patellofemoral replacements in patients with osteoarthritis were included. Articles that reviewed specifically complex primary surgeries or revisions were excluded. Survival and implant data were extracted, with all-cause survival of the knee replacement construct being the primary outcome. We also reviewed national joint replacement registry reports and extracted the data to be analysed separately. In the meta-analysis, we weighted each series and calculated a pooled survival estimate for each data source at 15 years, 20 years, and 25 years, using a fixed-effects model. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018105188. Findings From 4363 references found by our initial search, we identified 33 case series in 30 eligible articles, which reported all-cause survival for 6490 TKRs (26 case series) and 742 UKRs (seven case series). No case series reporting on patellofemoral replacements met our inclusion criteria, and no case series reported 25 year survival for TKR. The estimated 25 year survival for UKR (based on one case series) was 72.0% (95% CI 58.0-95.0). Registries contributed 299 291 TKRs (47 series) and 7714 UKRs (five series). The pooled registry 25 year survival of TKRs (14 registries) was 82.3% (95% CI 81.3-83.2) and of UKRs (four registries) was 69.8% (67.6-72.1). Interpretation Our pooled registry data, which we believe to be more accurate than the case series data, shows that approximately 82% of TKRs last 25 years and 70% of UKRs last 25 years. These findings will be of use to patients and health-care providers; further information is required to predict exactly how long specific knee replacements will last. Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

High heat stress can also reduce physical work capacity and motor-cognitive performances, with consequences for productivity, and increase the risk of occupational health problems. Almost half of the global population and more than 1 billion workers are exposed to high heat episodes and about a third of all exposed workers have negative health effects. However, excess deaths and many heat-related health risks are preventable, with appropriate heat action plans involving behavioural strategies and biophysical solutions. Extreme heat events are becoming permanent features of summer seasons worldwide, causing many excess deaths. Heat-related morbidity and mortality are projected to increase further as climate change progresses, with greater risk associated with higher degrees of global warming. Particularly in tropical regions, increased warming might mean that physiological limits related to heat tolerance (survival) will be reached regularly and more often in coming decades. Climate change is interacting with other trends, such as population growth and ageing, urbanisation, and socioeconomic development, that can either exacerbate or ameliorate heat-related hazards. Urban temperatures are further enhanced by anthropogenic heat from vehicular transport and heat waste from buildings. Although there is some evidence of adaptation to increasing temperatures in high-income countries, projections of a hotter future suggest that without investment in research and risk management actions, heat-related morbidity and mortality are likely to increase.","[Ebi, Kristie L.] Univ Washington, Ctr Hlth & Global Environm, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Capon, Anthony] Monash Univ, Monash Sustainable Dev Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Berry, Peter] Univ Waterloo, Fac Environm, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Broderick, Carolyn] UNSW, Sch Med Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Broderick, Carolyn] Childrens Hosp Westmead, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [de Dear, Richard] Univ Sydney, Sch Architecture Design & Planning, Indoor Environm Qual Lab, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Malik, Arunima] Univ Sydney, Discipline Accounting Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Malik, Arunima] Univ Sydney, Sch Phys, Fac Sci, ISA, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Morris, Nathan B.; Jay, Ollie] Univ Sydney, Thermal Ergon Lab, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Capon, Anthony; Jay, Ollie] Univ Sydney, Sydney Sch Publ Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Jay, Ollie] Univ Sydney, Fac Med & Hlth, Charles Perkins Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [de Dear, Richard] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Havenith, George] Loughborough Univ, Sch Design & Creat Arts, Environm Ergon Res Ctr, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Honda, Yasushi] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Hlth & Sport Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Kovats, R.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors, specifically anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies, have revolutionised the management of many cancers, particularly advanced melanoma, for which tumour regression and long-term durable cancer control is possible in nearly 50% of patients, compared with less than 10% historically. Despite the absence of adequately powered trial data, combined anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibition has the highest 5-year overall survival rate of all therapies in advanced melanoma, and has high activity in melanoma brain metastases. A phase 3 study has shown the addition of an anti-LAG3 antibody to nivolumab improves progression-free survival, but its effect on overall survival and how this combination compares to combined anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibition is unknown. At present, there are no highly sensitive and specific biomarkers of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors, and clinical factors, such as volume and sites of disease, serum lactate dehydrogenase, and BRAF mutation status, are used to select initial therapy for patients with advanced melanoma. Immune checkpoint inhibitors can induce autoimmune toxicities by virtue of their mechanism of action. These toxicities, termed immune-related adverse events, occur most frequently with combined anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibition; can have a variety of presentations; can affect any organ system (most often the skin, colon, endocrine system, and liver); and appear to mimic classic autoimmune diseases. Immune-related adverse events require prompt recognition and management, which may be different from the autoimmune disease it mimics. Immune checkpoint inhibitors appear to be safe for use in patients with HIV, viral hepatitis, and patients with mild-to-moderate pre-existing autoimmune diseases. Patients with organ transplants can respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors but have a high chance of transplant loss. PD-1 inhibitors are now an established standard of care as adjuvant therapy in high-risk resected stage III or IV melanoma. Neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibition for resectable stage III melanoma, which is currently limited to clinical trials, is emerging as a highly effective therapy.","[Carlino, Matteo S.; Long, Georgina V.] Univ Sydney, Melanoma Inst Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Carlino, Matteo S.] Blacktown Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Carlino, Matteo S.] Westmead Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Larkin, James] Royal Marsden NHS Fdn Trust, London, England; [Long, Georgina V.] Royal North Shore & Mater Hosp, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"Long, GV (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Melanoma Inst Australia, Sydney, NSW 2060, Australia.",georgina.long@sydney.edu.au,"Long, Georgina/C-1771-2013","Long, Georgina/0000-0001-8894-3545",National Institute of Health Research/Institute of Cancer Research Biomedical Research Centre for cancer; NHMRC Practitioner Fellowship; Melanoma Institute Australia; University of Sydney Medical Foundation,National Institute of Health Research/Institute of Cancer Research Biomedical Research Centre for cancer; NHMRC Practitioner Fellowship(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Melanoma Institute Australia; University of Sydney Medical Foundation(University of Sydney),"JL is supported by National Institute of Health Research/Institute of Cancer Research Biomedical Research Centre for cancer.

Results from an investment- case analysis can provide important new evidence to inform decision making by governments and donors. We propose a methodology for calculating the economic benefits of investing in NCDs during the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) era, and we applied this methodology to cardiovascular disease prevention in 20 countries with the highest NCD burden. For a limited set of prevention interventions, we estimated that US$120 billion must be invested in these countries between 2015 and 2030. This investment represents an additional $1.50 per capita per year and would avert 15 million deaths, 8 million incidents of ischaemic heart disease, and 13 million incidents of stroke in the 20 countries. Benefit-cost ratios varied between interventions and country-income levels, with an average ratio of 5.6 for economic returns but a ratio of 10.9 if social returns are included. Investing in cardiovascular disease prevention is integral to achieving SDG target 3.4 (reducing premature mortality from NCDs by a third) and to progress towards SDG target 3.8 (the realisation of universal health coverage). Many countries have implemented cost-effective interventions at low levels, so the potential to achieve these targets and strengthen national income by scaling up these interventions is enormous.","[Bertram, Melanie Y.; Lauer, Jeremy A.; Chisholm, Daniel] WHO, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Sweeny, Kim; Sheehan, Peter; Rasmussen, Bruce] Victoria Univ, Victoria Inst Strateg Econ Studies, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Upreti, Senendra Raj] Minist Hlth, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Dixit, Lonim Prasai] WHO, Kathmandu, Nepal; [George, Kenneth; Deane, Samuel] Minist Hlth, Bridgetown, Barbados",,"Bertram, MY (corresponding author), WHO, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",bertramm@who.int,,"Sheehan, Peter/0000-0001-9450-8371",Global Coordination Mechanism for Non-Communicable Disease at WHO,Global Coordination Mechanism for Non-Communicable Disease at WHO,The economic benefits analysis and the Investment Case analysis for Barbados were supported by funds from the Global Coordination Mechanism for Non-Communicable Disease at WHO.

Although general health checks are often expected and advocated by patients, clinicians, insurers, and health systems, others question their value. Observations Randomized trials and observational studies with control groups reported in prior systematic reviews and an updated literature review through March 2021 were included. Among 19 randomized trials (906 to 59 616 participants; follow-up, 1 to 30 years), 5 evaluated a single general health check, 7 evaluated annual health checks, 1 evaluated biannual checks, and 6 evaluated health checks delivered at other frequencies. Twelve of 13 observational studies (240 to 471 415 participants; follow-up, cross-sectional to 5 years) evaluated a single general health check. General health checks were generally not associated with decreased mortality, cardiovascular events, or cardiovascular disease incidence. For example, in the South-East London Screening Study (n = 7229), adults aged 40 to 64 years who were invited to 2 health checks over 2 years, compared with adults not invited to screening, experienced no 8-year mortality benefit (6% vs 5%). General health checks were associated with increased detection of chronic diseases, such as depression and hypertension; moderate improvements in controlling risk factors, such as blood pressure and cholesterol; increased clinical preventive service uptake, such as colorectal and cervical cancer screening; and improvements in patient-reported outcomes, such as quality of life and self-rated health. In the Danish Check-In Study (n = 1104), more patients randomized to receive to a single health check, compared with those randomized to receive usual care, received a new antidepressant prescription over 1 year (5% vs 2%; P = .007). In a propensity score-matched analysis (n = 8917), a higher percentage of patients who attended a Medicare Annual Wellness Visit, compared with those who did not, underwent colorectal cancer screening (69% vs 60%; P < .01). General health checks were sometimes associated with modest improvements in health behaviors such as physical activity and diet. In the OXCHECK trial (n = 4121), fewer patients randomized to receive annual health checks, compared with those not randomized to receive health checks, exercised less than once per month (68% vs 71%; difference, 3.3% [95% CI, 0.5%-6.1%]). Potential adverse effects in individual studies included an increased risk of stroke and increased mortality attributed to increased completion of advance directives. Conclusions and Relevance General health checks were not associated with reduced mortality or cardiovascular events, but were associated with increased chronic disease recognition and treatment, risk factor control, preventive service uptake, and improved patient-reported outcomes. Primary care teams may reasonably offer general health checks, especially for groups at high risk of overdue preventive services, uncontrolled risk factors, low self-rated health, or poor connection or inadequate access to primary care. This review provides updated evidence on general health checks in multiple important outcome domains, including mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, and risk factor control.","[Liss, David T.; Uchida, Toshiko; Wilkes, Cheryl L.; Linder, Jeffrey A.] Northwestern Univ, Div Gen Internal Med & Geriatr, Feinberg Sch Med, 750 N Lake Shore Dr,10th Floor, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Radakrishnan, Ankitha] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA",,"Liss, DT (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Div Gen Internal Med & Geriatr, Feinberg Sch Med, 750 N Lake Shore Dr,10th Floor, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",david.liss@northwestern.edu,,"Linder, Jeffrey/0000-0003-2217-184X; Liss, David/0000-0001-5505-2922","AHRQ HHS [R01 HS028127, R01 HS026506] Funding Source: Medline; NIA NIH HHS [R01 AG069762, R33 AG057383, P30 AG059988, R33 AG057395] Funding Source: Medline; NIDDK NIH HHS [R18 DK110741, R34 DK114773] Funding Source: Medline",AHRQ HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality); NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); NIDDK NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)),,,73,10,10,3,16,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Approximately 2 million osteoporotic fractures occurred in the United States in 2005, and annual incidence is projected to increase to more than 3 million fractures by 2025. Within 1 year of experiencing a hip fracture, many patients are unable to walk independently, more than half require assistance with activities of daily living, and 20% to 30% of patients will die. OBJECTIVE To update the 2013 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on vitamin D supplementation, with or without calcium, to prevent fractures. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on vitamin D, calcium, and combined supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling adults (defined as not living in a nursing home or other institutional care setting). The review excluded studies conducted in populations with a known disorder related to bone metabolism (eg, osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency), taking medications known to be associated with osteoporosis (eg, long-term steroids), or with a previous fracture. FINDINGS The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to estimate the benefits of vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation to prevent fractures in community-dwelling men and premenopausal women. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that daily supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calcium has no benefit for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal women. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to estimate the benefits of doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D or greater than 1000 mg of calcium to prevent fractures in community-dwelling postmenopausal women. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that supplementation with vitamin D and calcium increases the incidence of kidney stones. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of the benefits and harms of vitamin D and calcium supplementation, alone or combined, for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, asymptomatic men and premenopausal women. (I statement) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of the benefits and harms of daily supplementation with doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D and greater than 1000 mg of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal women. (I statement) The USPSTF recommends against daily supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal women. (D recommendation) These recommendations do not apply to persons with a history of osteoporotic fractures, increased risk for falls, or a diagnosis of osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency.","[Grossman, David C.] Kaiser Permanente, Washington Hlth Res Inst, Seattle, WA 98101 USA; [Curry, Susan J.] Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA USA; [Owens, Douglas K.] Vet Affairs Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Palo Alto, CA USA; [Owens, Douglas K.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA USA; [Barry, Michael J.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA USA; [Caughey, Aaron B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, OR USA; [Davidson, Karina W.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA; [Doubeni, Chyke A.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Epling, John W., Jr.] Virginia Tech Caril Sch Med, Roanoke, VA USA; [Kemper, Alex R.] Nationwide Childrens Hosp, Columbus, OH USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Fairfax Family Practice Residency, Fairfax, VA USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, VA USA; [Kubik, Martha] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Landefeld, Seth] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL USA; [Mangione, Carol M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Silverstein, Michael] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Simon, Melissa A.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Univ Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Tseng, Chien-Wen] Pacific Hlth Res & Educ Inst, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",,"Grossman, DC (corresponding author), Kaiser Permanente, Washington Hlth Res Inst, Seattle, WA 98101 USA.",chair@uspstf.net,"Epling, John W/J-1097-2019; Davidson, Karina/AAG-2388-2019","Epling, John W/0000-0001-9445-8669; Davidson, Karina/0000-0002-9162-477X; Kemper, Alex/0000-0001-5491-3997",Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ),Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality),"The USPSTF is an independent, voluntary body.

Of 3166 papers found, 24 are included in this Review. Most reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects. In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided.

OBJECTIVE To systematically review the evidence on the benefits and harms of behavioral counseling for skin cancer prevention to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). DATA SOURCES Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and PubMed were searched for studies published from January 2009 to March 31, 2016, for skin cancer prevention and from August 2005 to March 31, 2016, for skin self-examination. Surveillance in targeted publications was conducted through February 14, 2018. Studies included in previous USPSTF reports were reevaluated for inclusion. STUDY SELECTION Fair- and good-quality studies of primary care-relevant behavioral interventions focused on improving skin cancer outcomes, intermediate outcomes, or skin cancer prevention and self-examination behaviors. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles and extracted data into evidence tables. Results were qualitatively summarized but not pooled because of heterogeneity of measures. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Skin cancer, sunburn, precursor skin lesions, sun protection behaviors, and any harms from interventions. RESULTS Twenty-one trials in 27 publications were included (N = 20 561). No studies assessed skin cancer outcomes in pediatric populations; 1 adult trial (n = 1356) promoting skin self-examination found no significant difference in participants diagnosed with melanoma in the intervention group vs the control group at 12-month follow-up (0 vs 1 diagnosis). There was no consistent improvement in prevention of sunburn for children (3 trials [n 2508]) or adults (6 trials [n = 3959]). There were small to moderate increases in sun protection behavior in pediatric populations (6 trials [n 4252]) and adults (12 trials [n = 13 099]) and small increases in skin self-examination in adults (11 trials [n 7771]; odds ratios, 1.16-2.6). One of 3 trials of indoor tanning found an intervention effect; an appearance-focused intervention (n = 430) resulted in a smaller increase in mean indoor tanning sessions at 6 months in the intervention group vs the control group. Harms were rarely reported: 1 trial of skin self-examination (n = 1356) found an increase in skin procedures in the intervention group vs the control group at 6 months (8.0% vs 3.6%, P <.001) but not between 6 and 12 months (3.9% vs 3.3%, P =.50), and 1 trial (n = 217) found no between-group difference in skin cancer worry (28.9% vs 18.4%, P =.16). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Behavioral interventions can increase sun protection behavior, but there is no consistent evidence that interventions are associated with a reduction in the frequency of sunburn in children or adults and minimal evidence on skin cancer outcomes. Intervention can increase skin self-examination in adults but may lead to increased skin procedures without detecting additional atypical nevi or skin cancers.","[Henrikson, Nora B.; Morrison, Caitlin C.; Blasi, Paula R.; Nguyen, Matt] Kaiser Permanente Washington Hlth Res Inst, Kaiser Permanente Res Affiliates Evidence Based P, Seattle, WA 98101 USA; [Shibuya, Kendall C.] Western Univ Hlth Sci COMP Northwest, Lebanon, OR USA; [Patnode, Carrie D.] Kaiser Permanente Ctr Hlth Res, Kaiser Permanente Res Affiliates Evidence Based P, Portland, OR USA",,"Henrikson, NB (corresponding author), Kaiser Permanente Washington Hlth Res Inst, 1730 Minor Ave, Seattle, WA 98101 USA.",Nora.B.Henrikson@kp.org,,"Blasi, Paula/0000-0002-7094-706X","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA290201500007I, 2]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services","This research was funded under contract HHSA290201500007I, Task Order 2, from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), US Department of Health and Human Services, under a contract to support the USPSTF.",,70,33,33,1,5,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

The Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) consists of the first 2 items of the PHQ-9 (which assess the frequency of depressed mood and anhedonia) and can be used as a first step to identify patients for evaluation with the full PHQ-9. Objective To estimate PHQ-2 accuracy alone and combined with the PHQ-9 for detecting major depression. Data Sources MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, PsycINFO, and Web of Science (January 2000-May 2018). Study Selection Eligible data sets compared PHQ-2 scores with major depression diagnoses from a validated diagnostic interview. Data Extraction and Synthesis Individual participant data were synthesized with bivariate random-effects meta-analysis to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity of the PHQ-2 alone among studies using semistructured, fully structured, or Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) diagnostic interviews separately and in combination with the PHQ-9 vs the PHQ-9 alone for studies that used semistructured interviews. The PHQ-2 score ranges from 0 to 6, and the PHQ-9 score ranges from 0 to 27. Results Individual participant data were obtained from 100 of 136 eligible studies (44 318 participants; 4572 with major depression [10%]; mean [SD] age, 49 [17] years; 59% female). Among studies that used semistructured interviews, PHQ-2 sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) were 0.91 (0.88-0.94) and 0.67 (0.64-0.71) for cutoff scores of 2 or greater and 0.72 (0.67-0.77) and 0.85 (0.83-0.87) for cutoff scores of 3 or greater. Sensitivity was significantly greater for semistructured vs fully structured interviews. Specificity was not significantly different across the types of interviews. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.88 (0.86-0.89) for semistructured interviews, 0.82 (0.81-0.84) for fully structured interviews, and 0.87 (0.85-0.88) for the MINI. There were no significant subgroup differences. For semistructured interviews, sensitivity for PHQ-2 scores of 2 or greater followed by PHQ-9 scores of 10 or greater (0.82 [0.76-0.86]) was not significantly different than PHQ-9 scores of 10 or greater alone (0.86 [0.80-0.90]); specificity for the combination was significantly but minimally higher (0.87 [0.84-0.89] vs 0.85 [0.82-0.87]). The area under the curve was 0.90 (0.89-0.91). The combination was estimated to reduce the number of participants needing to complete the full PHQ-9 by 57% (56%-58%). Conclusions and Relevance In an individual participant data meta-analysis of studies that compared PHQ scores with major depression diagnoses, the combination of PHQ-2 (with cutoff >= 2) followed by PHQ-9 (with cutoff >= 10) had similar sensitivity but higher specificity compared with PHQ-9 cutoff scores of 10 or greater alone. Further research is needed to understand the clinical and research value of this combined approach to screening.","[Levis, Brooke; Sun, Ying; He, Chen; Wu, Yin; Krishnan, Ankur; Bhandari, Parash Mani; Neupane, Dipika; Imran, Mahrukh; Brehaut, Eliana; Negeri, Zelalem; Thombs, Brett D.] Jewish Gen Hosp, Lady Davis Inst Med Res, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Levis, Brooke; Wu, Yin; Bhandari, Parash Mani; Neupane, Dipika; Negeri, Zelalem; Benedetti, Andrea; Thombs, Brett D.] McGill Univ, Dept Epidemiol Biostat & Occupat Hlth, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Wu, Yin; Thombs, Brett D.] McGill Univ, Dept Psychiat, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Fischer, Felix H.] Univ Med Berlin, Charite, Dept Psychosomat Med, Ctr Internal Med & Dermatol, Berlin, Germany; [Benedetti, Andrea; Thombs, Brett D.] McGill Univ, Dept Med, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Benedetti, Andrea] McGill Univ, Resp Epidemiol & Clin Res Unit, Ctr Hlth, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Thombs, Brett D.] McGill Univ, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Thombs, Brett D.] McGill Univ, Dept Educ & Counselling Psychol, Montreal, PQ, Canada",,"Thombs, BD (corresponding author), Jewish Gen Hosp, 4333 Cote Ste Catherine Rd, Montreal, PQ H3T 1E4, Canada.",brett.thombs@mcgill.ca,"TRAN, THACH DUC/H-7734-2014; fischer, felix/AAW-6634-2021; Patten, Scott/B-4434-2011; Gilbody, Simon/AAY-3720-2021; Wu, Yin/AFR-0274-2022; Conway, Aaron/T-2421-2018; Diez-Quevedo, Crisanto/A-4425-2009; Navarrete Reyes, Laura Elena/M-6682-2017; Rathod, Sujit D/M-9298-2014","TRAN, THACH DUC/0000-0002-4686-8601; fischer, felix/0000-0002-9693-6676; Patten, Scott/0000-0001-9871-4041; Gilbody, Simon/0000-0002-8236-6983; Conway, Aaron/0000-0002-9583-8636; Negeri, Zelalem/0000-0002-3154-3855; Suzuki, Keiko/0000-0002-4285-0658; Winkley, Kirsty/0000-0002-1725-6040; Diez-Quevedo, Crisanto/0000-0002-0705-295X; Navarrete Reyes, Laura Elena/0000-0001-5421-9794; Rathod, Sujit D/0000-0001-8783-7724; Delgadillo, Jaime/0000-0001-5349-230X; Fung, Daniel/0000-0003-0718-9363; Swartz, Rick/0000-0001-6571-5531","Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [KRS-134297, PCG-155468, PJT-162206]; CIHR; Fonds de recherche du Quebec-Sante (FRQS); FRQS; Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre; Faculty of Medicine, McGill University","Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); CIHR(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Fonds de recherche du Quebec-Sante (FRQS); FRQS; Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre; Faculty of Medicine, McGill University","This study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR; grants KRS-134297, PCG-155468, and PJT-162206).

Brain injury after resuscitation, a common sequela following cardiac arrest, ranges in severity from mild impairment to devastating brain injury and brainstem death. Effective strategies to minimise brain injury after resuscitation include early intervention with cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation, restoration of normal physiology, and targeted temperature management. It is important to identify people who might have a poor outcome, to enable informed choices about continuation or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments. Multimodal prediction guidelines seek to avoid premature withdrawal in those who might survive with a good neurological outcome, or prolonging treatment that might result in survival with severe disability. Approximately one in three admitted to intensive care will survive, many of whom will need intensive, tailored rehabilitation after discharge to have the best outcomes.","[Perkins, Gavin D.; Haywood, Kirstie; Nolan, Jerry P.] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Perkins, Gavin D.] Univ Hosp Birmingham, Crit Care Unit, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Callaway, Clifton W.; Sawyer, Kelly N.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Neumar, Robert W.] Univ Michigan, Dept Emergency Med, Michigan Ctr Integrat Res Crit Care, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Lilja, Gisela] Lund Univ, Skane Univ Hosp, Dept Clin Sci Lund, Neurol, Lund, Sweden; [Rowland, Matthew J.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Clin Neurosci, Kadoorie Ctr Crit Care Res, Oxford, England; [Skrifvars, Markus B.] Univ Helsinki, Dept Emergency Care & Serv, Helsinki, Finland; [Skrifvars, Markus B.] Helsinki Univ Hosp, Helsinki, Finland; [Nolan, Jerry P.] Royal United Hosp, Anaesthesia & Intens Care Med, Bath, Avon, England",,"Perkins, GD (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",g.d.perkins@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,79,9,11,6,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,OCT 2,2021,398,10307,,,,,1269,1278,,10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00953-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00953-3,,SEP 2021,10,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,WC6VF,34454687,Green Accepted,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000704393000025,View Full Record in Web of Science,96218,0,29,63,16,41,28,36,74,34,56,21,75,2,28,75,6

One trend, fuelled by the failure of conventional therapies in a subset of patients and the broad-spectrum use of antifibrotic therapies, has been the focus on the progressive fibrosing phenotype of interstitial lung disease. The histological pattern, known as usual interstitial pneumonia, is the archetype of progressive fibrosis. However, it is clear that progressive fibrosis is not exclusive to this histological entity. Techniques including immunohistochemistry and single-cell RNA sequencing are providing pathogenetic insights and, if integrated with traditional histopathology, are likely to have an effect on the pathological classification of interstitial lung disease. This review, which focuses on the histopathology of interstitial lung disease and its relationship with progressive fibrosis, asks the question: is it all about usual interstitial pneumonia?","[Renzoni, Elisabetta A.] Guys & St Thomas NHS Fdn Trust, Royal Brompton & Harefield Clin Grp, Interstitial Lung Dis Unit, London, England; [Renzoni, Elisabetta A.] Imperial Coll London, Natl Heart & Lung Inst, Margaret Turner Warwick Ctr Fibrosing Lung Dis, London, England; [Poletti, Venerino] Aarhus Univ Hosp, Dept Resp Dis & Allergy, Aarhus, Denmark; [Poletti, Venerino] Univ Bologna, GB Morgagni Hosp, Thorac Dis Dept, Forli, Italy; [Mackintosh, John A.] Prince Charles Hosp, Dept Thorac Med, Brisbane, Qld 4032, Australia",,"Mackintosh, JA (corresponding author), Prince Charles Hosp, Dept Thorac Med, Brisbane, Qld 4032, Australia.",john.mackintosh@health.qld.gov.au,,"Mackintosh, John/0000-0002-5254-4144",,,,,96,5,5,1,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,OCT 16,2021,398,10309,,,,,1437,1449,,10.1016/S0140-6736(21)01961-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)01961-9,,OCT 2021,13,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,WI0TQ,34499865,,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000708080400023,View Full Record in Web of Science,96227,0,19,87,53,79,56,7,3,40,78,56,4,35,9,83,23

Instead, it is a complex social system that structures the life experience of all human beings. This paper, the first in a Series of five papers, investigates the relationships between gender inequality, restrictive gender norms, and health and wellbeing. Building upon past work, we offer a consolidated conceptual framework that shows how individuals born biologically male or female develop into gendered beings, and how sexism and patriarchy intersect with other forms of discrimination, such as racism, classism, and homophobia, to structure pathways to poor health. We discuss the ample evidence showing the far-reaching consequences of these pathways, including how gender inequality and restrictive gender norms impact health through differential exposures, health-related behaviours and access to care, as well as how gender-biased health research and health-care systems reinforce and reproduce gender inequalities, with serious implications for health. The cumulative consequences of structured disadvantage, mediated through discriminatory laws, policies, and institutions, as well as diet, stress, substance use, and environmental toxins, have triggered important discussions about the role of social injustice in the creation and maintenance of health inequities, especially along racial and socioeconomic lines. This Series paper raises the parallel question of whether discrimination based on gender likewise becomes embodied, with negative consequences for health. For decades, advocates have worked to eliminate gender discrimination in global health, with only modest success. A new plan and new political commitment are needed if these global health aspirations and the wider Sustainable Development Goals of the UN are to be achieved.","[Heise, Lori; Opper, Neisha; Heise, Lori] Johns Hopkins Sch Nursing, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Populat Family & Reprod Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Greene, Margaret E.] GreeneWorks, Washington, DC USA; [Stavropoulou, Maria; Harper, Caroline] Overseas Dev Inst, Programme Gender Equal & Social Inclus, London, England; [Nascimento, Marcos] Inst Fernandes Figueira Fiocruz, Programa Posgrad Saude Crianca & Mulher, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Zewdie, Debrework] CUNY, Sch Publ Hlth & Hlth Policy, New York, NY 10021 USA",,"Heise, L (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Sch Nursing, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Populat Family & Reprod Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",lheise1@jhu.edu,"Darmstadt, Gary/AAU-7488-2020; Hawkes, Sarah/AAK-7375-2020; Heise, LORI/AAI-6251-2020","Nascimento, Marcos/0000-0002-3363-4232; Heymann, Jody/0000-0003-0008-4198","Gender Equality, Integrated Delivery, HIV, Nutrition, Family Planning, and Water Sanitation; Hygiene program strategy teams at the Bill AMP; Melinda Gates Foundation; United Arab Emirates Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation","Gender Equality, Integrated Delivery, HIV, Nutrition, Family Planning, and Water Sanitation; Hygiene program strategy teams at the Bill AMP; Melinda Gates Foundation; United Arab Emirates Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation","The work of the Series was funded by the Gender Equality, Integrated Delivery, HIV, Nutrition, Family Planning, and Water Sanitation and Hygiene program strategy teams at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and by the United Arab Emirates Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation through grants to Stanford University, received by LH, MEG, NO, MS, and CH.

Conjugate vaccines against the three most common causative pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae) have reduced the incidence of disease, but with the replacement by non-vaccine pneumococcal serotypes and the emergence of bacterial strains with reduced susceptibility to antimicrobial treatment, meningitis continues to pose a major health challenge worldwide. In patients presenting with bacterial meningitis, typical clinical characteristics (such as the classic triad of neck stiffness, fever, and an altered mental status) might be absent and cerebrospinal fluid examination for biochemistry, microscopy, culture, and PCR to identify bacterial DNA are essential for the diagnosis. Multiplex PCR point-of-care panels in cerebrospinal fluid show promise in accelerating the diagnosis, but diagnostic accuracy studies to justify routine implementation are scarce and randomised, controlled studies are absent. Early administration of antimicrobial treatment (within 1 hour of presentation) improves outcomes and needs to be adjusted according to local emergence of drug resistance. Adjunctive dexamethasone treatment has proven efficacy beyond the neonatal age but only in patients from high-income countries. Further progress can be expected from implementing preventive measures, especially the development of new vaccines, implementation of hospital protocols aimed at early treatment, and new treatments targeting checkpoints of the inflammatory cascade.","[van de Beek, Diederik; Brouwer, Matthijs C.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam Neurosci, Dept Neurol, Meibergdreef, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Koedel, Uwe] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Neurol, Munich, Germany; [Wall, Emma C.] UCL, Res Dept Infect, London, England; [Wall, Emma C.] Francis Crick Inst, London, England",,"Van de Beek, D (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, Locat AMC, Dept Neurol, Meibergdreef 9, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands.",d.vandebeek@amsterdamumc.nl,,"van de Beek, Diederik/0000-0002-4571-044X; Wall, Emma/0000-0003-2732-4497; Brouwer, Matthijs/0000-0001-7775-7843",ZonMw Vici; ZonMw Vidi; European Research Council consolidator grant; German Research Foundation; Francis Crick Institute; National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Department of Health's NIHR Biomedical Research Centre,ZonMw Vici; ZonMw Vidi(Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development); European Research Council consolidator grant(European Research Council (ERC)); German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Francis Crick Institute; National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Department of Health's NIHR Biomedical Research Centre,DvdB is funded by a grant from ZonMw Vici.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is present in an estimated 1% to 6% of premenopausal women and an estimated 2% to 10% of pregnant women and is associated with pyelonephritis, one of the most common nonobstetric reasons for hospitalization in pregnant women. Among pregnant persons, pyelonephritis is associated with perinatal complications including septicemia, respiratory distress, low birth weight, and spontaneous preterm birth. ObjectiveTo update its 2008 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on potential benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults, including pregnant persons. PopulationThis recommendation applies to community-dwelling adults 18 years and older and pregnant persons of any age without signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection. Evidence AssessmentBased on a review of the evidence, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons has moderate net benefit in reducing perinatal complications. There is adequate evidence that pyelonephritis in pregnancy is associated with negative maternal outcomes and that treatment of screen-detected asymptomatic bacteriuria can reduce the incidence of pyelonephritis in pregnant persons. The USPSTF found adequate evidence of harms associated with treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (including adverse effects of antibiotic treatment and changes in the microbiome) to be at least small in magnitude. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant adults has no net benefit. The known harms associated with treatment include adverse effects of antibiotic use and changes to the microbiome. Based on these known harms, the USPSTF determined the overall harms to be at least small in this group. RecommendationsThe USPSTF recommends screening pregnant persons for asymptomatic bacteriuria using urine culture. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant adults. (D recommendation) This 2019 Recommendation Statement from the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening pregnant persons for asymptomatic bacteriuria using urine culture (B recommendation) and recommends against screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant adults (D recommendation).","[Owens, Douglas K.] Vet Affairs Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Palo Alto, CA USA; [Owens, Douglas K.] Stanford Univ, 616 Serra St,Encina Hall,Room C336, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Davidson, Karina W.] Northwell Hlth, Feinstein Inst Med Res, New York, NY USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Fairfax Family Practice Residency, Fairfax, VA USA; [Krist, Alex H.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, VA USA; [Barry, Michael J.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Cabana, Michael] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Caughey, Aaron B.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Doubeni, Chyke A.] Mayo Clin, Rochester, NY USA; [Epling, John W., Jr.] Virginia Tech, Carilion Sch Med, Roanoke, VA USA; [Kubik, Martha] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Landefeld, C.

Importance Nearly 10 million US adults experience stable angina, which occurs when myocardial oxygen supply does not meet demand, resulting in myocardial ischemia. Stable angina is associated with an average annual risk of 3% to 4% for myocardial infarction or death. Diagnostic tests and medical therapies for stable angina have evolved over the last decade with a better understanding of the optimal use of coronary revascularization. Observations Coronary computed tomographic angiography is a first-line diagnostic test in the evaluation of patients with stable angina due to higher sensitivity and comparable specificity compared with imaging-based stress testing. Moreover, coronary computed tomographic angiography allows detection of nonobstructive atherosclerosis that would not be identified with other noninvasive imaging modalities, improving risk assessment and potentially triggering more appropriate allocation of preventive therapies. Novel therapies treating lipids (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, ezetimibe, and icosapent ethyl) and type 2 diabetes (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists) have improved cardiovascular outcomes in patients with stable ischemic heart disease when added to usual care. Randomized clinical trials showed no improvement in the rates of mortality or myocardial infarction with revascularization (largely by percutaneous coronary intervention) compared with optimal medical therapy alone, even in the setting of moderate to severe ischemia. In contrast, revascularization provides a meaningful benefit on angina and quality of life compared with antianginal therapies. Measures of the effect of angina on a patient's quality of life should be integrated into the clinic encounter to assist with the decision to proceed with revascularization. Conclusions and Relevance For patients with stable angina, emphasis should be placed on optimizing lifestyle factors and preventive medications such as lipid-lowering and antiplatelet agents to reduce the risk for cardiovascular events and death. Antianginal medications, such as beta-blockers, nitrates, or calcium channel blockers, should be initiated to improve angina symptoms. Revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention should be reserved for patients in whom angina symptoms negatively influence quality of life, generally after a trial of antianginal medical therapy. Shared decision-making with an informed patient is important for effective treatment of stable angina.","[Joshi, Parag H.; de Lemos, James A.] Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Internal Med, Div Cardiol, 5909 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX 76390 USA",,"de Lemos, JA (corresponding author), Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Internal Med, Div Cardiol, 5909 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX 76390 USA.",james.delemos@utsouthwestern.edu,"de Lemos, James/ABD-6669-2021",,,,,,119,6,6,4,17,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

Transcatheter valve repair has emerged as an important therapeutic option for patients who are candidates for heart valve replacement. OBSERVATIONS All transcatheter valve therapies involve a multidisciplinary team of interventional cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, radiologists, echocardiographers, nurses, and social workers, termed the heart team, to determine the optimal approach for managing each patient. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an aortic valve replacement procedure that is performed percutaneously and is currently approved for patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis in all surgical risk categories. The TAVI procedure can be performed using a balloon-expandable or self-expanding valve. In a low-risk cohort of patients (PARTNER [Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves] 3 trial), the rates of death from any cause, stroke, or rehospitalization were 8.5% for patients receiving TAVI and 15.1% for patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement. Decision-making regarding therapy choice should be based on individual anatomy (including the number of leaflets, annular size, and peripheral arterial anatomy), comorbidities (including concomitant coronary artery disease and aortopathies), and patient preference guide. A mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair device is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for high-risk patients with degenerative and functional mitral regurgitation that has excellent safety and efficacy in these populations. In the COAPT (Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients with Functional Mitral Regurgitation) trial, the annualized rate of all hospitalizations for heart failure was 35.8% among patients who underwent transcatheter edge-to-edge repair and received medical therapy compared with 67.9% among patients in the medical therapy alone group. Transcatheter tricuspid valve repair and replacement trials are ongoing and show promise for the treatment of patients with tricuspid regurgitation, which previously had limited therapeutic options. Multimodality imaging, which includes transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, and intracardiac echocardiography, is important for preprocedural planning, device selection, and optimal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Approximately 78 000 TAVI procedures and 10 000 transcatheter mitral valve repairs take place yearly in the US to treat patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation, respectively. Transcatheter valve therapies have expanded therapeutic options for patients, including for those who previously had no viable surgical options.","Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Bluhm Cardiovasc Inst, Dept Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Bluhm Cardiovasc Inst, Dept Cardiol, Chicago, IL 60611 USA",,"Davidson, CJ (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, 676 N St Clair St,Ste 2300, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",cdavidson@nm.org,,,,,,,51,11,13,6,14,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

These guidelines aim to address the needs of diverse populations. Biological sex and gender identity are sources of diversity that are not often considered in studies of clinical preventive services that inform the recommendations, resulting in challenges when evaluating the evidence and communicating recommendations for persons in specific gender identification categories (man/woman/gender nonbinary/gender nonconforming/transgender). To advance its methods, the USPSTF reviewed its past recommendations that included the use of sex and gender terms, reviewed the approaches of other guideline-making bodies, and pilot tested strategies to address sex and gender diversity. Based on the findings, the USPSTF intends to use an inclusive approach to identify issues related to sex and gender at the start of the guideline development process; assess the applicability, variability, and quality of evidence as a function of sex and gender; ensure clarity in the use of language regarding sex and gender; and identify evidence gaps related to sex and gender. Evidence reviews will identify the limitations of applying findings to diverse groups from underlying studies that used unclear terminology regarding sex and gender. The USPSTF will use gender-neutral language when appropriate to communicate that recommendations are inclusive of people of any gender and will clearly state when recommendations apply to individuals with specific anatomy associated with biological sex (male/female) or to specific categories of gender identity.

STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of screening, referral, and treatment; and studies of screening test diagnostic accuracy. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS One investigator abstracted data and a second checked accuracy. Two investigators independently assessed study quality. RESULTS Eighty-three studies (N = 75 887) were included (30 trials and 53 diagnostic accuracy studies). One RCT (n = 616) found screening of frail elderly persons associated with no difference in vision outcomes vs no screening but with significantly greater falls risk (relative risk [RR], 1.31 [95% CI, 1.13-1.50]). No study evaluated referral to an eye health professional. For glaucoma diagnosis, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (providing high-resolution cross-sectional imaging; 15 studies, n = 4242) was associated with sensitivity of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.75-0.83) and specificity of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.87-0.96) and the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer (for perimetry, or measurement of visual fields; 6 studies, n = 11 244) with sensitivity of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.69-0.95) and specificity 0.82 (95% CI, 0.66-0.92); tonometry (for measurement of intraocular pressure; 13 studies, n = 32 892) had low sensitivity (0.48 [95% CI, 0.31-0.66]). Medical therapy for ocular hypertension and untreated glaucoma was significantly associated with decreased intraocular pressure and decreased likelihood of glaucoma progression (7 trials, n = 3771; RR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.49-0.96]; absolute risk difference -4.2%) vs placebo, but 1 trial (n = 461) found no differences in visual acuity, quality of life, or function. Selective laser trabeculoplasty and medical therapy had similar outcomes (4 trials, n = 957).

Strong provoking risk factors for venous thromboembolism include major surgery and active cancer, but most events are unprovoked. Diagnosis requires a sequential work-up that combines assessment of clinical pretest probability for venous thromboembolism using a clinical score (eg, Wells score), D-dimer testing, and imaging. Venous thromboembolism can be considered excluded in patients with both a non-high clinical pretest probability and normal D-dimer concentrations. When required, ultrasonography should be done for a suspected deep vein thrombosis and CT or ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy for a suspected pulmonary embolism. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are the first-line treatment for almost all patients with venous thromboembolism (including those with cancer). After completing 3-6 months of initial treatment, anticoagulation can be discontinued in patients with venous thromboembolism provoked by a major transient risk factor. Patients whose long-term risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism outweighs the long-term risk of major bleeding, such as those with active cancer or men with unprovoked venous thromboembolism, should receive indefinite anticoagulant treatment. Pharmacological venous thromboembolism prophylaxis is generally warranted in patients undergoing major orthopaedic or cancer surgery. Ongoing research is focused on improving diagnostic strategies for suspected deep vein thrombosis, comparing different DOACs, developing safer anticoagulants, and further individualising approaches for the prevention and management of venous thromboembolism.","[Khan, Faizan] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Sch Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Khan, Faizan; Rodger, Marc A.] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Clin Epidemiol Program, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Tritschler, Tobias] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Dept Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Tritschler, Tobias] Univ Bern, Bern Univ Hosp, Dept Gen Internal Med, Inselspital, Bern, Switzerland; [Khan, Faizan; Rodger, Marc A.] McGill Univ, Dept Med, Montreal, PQ H4A 3J1, Canada; [Kahn, Susan R.] Jewish Gen Hosp, Lady Davis Inst, Div Internal Med, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Kahn, Susan R.] Jewish Gen Hosp, Lady Davis Inst, Div Clin Epidemiol, Montreal, PQ, Canada",,"Rodger, MA (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Med, Montreal, PQ H4A 3J1, Canada.",marc.rodger@mcgill.ca,"Tritschler, Tobias/ABH-1772-2021","Tritschler, Tobias/0000-0002-8775-0511; , Faizan/0000-0001-7570-0755",Canadian Institutes of Health Research,Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),All authors are investigators of the CanVECTOR Network; the Network receives grant funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CDT-142654).

Idiopathic scoliosis is the most common form and usually worsens during adolescence before skeletal maturity. Severe spinal curvature may be associated with adverse long-term health outcomes (eg, pulmonary disorders, disability, back pain, psychological effects, cosmetic issues, and reduced quality of life). Early identification and effective treatment of mild scoliosis could slow or stop curvature progression before skeletal maturity, thereby improving long-term outcomes in adulthood. OBJECTIVE To update the 2004 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for idiopathic scoliosis in asymptomatic adolescents. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. FINDINGS The USPSTF found no direct evidence on screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and health outcomes and no evidence on the harms of screening. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on treatment with exercise and surgery. It found adequate evidence that treatment with bracingmay slow curvature progression in adolescents with mild or moderate curvature severity (Cobb angle <40 degrees to 50 degrees); however, evidence on the association between reduction in spinal curvature in adolescence and long-term health outcomes in adulthood is inadequate. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of treatment. Therefore, the USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis cannot be determined. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis in children and adolescents aged 10 to 18 years.

Congenital syphilis is associated with stillbirth, neonatal death, and significant morbidity in infants (eg, bone deformities and neurologic impairment). After a steady decline from 2008 to 2012, cases of congenital syphilis markedly increased from 2012 to 2106, from 8.4 to 15.7 cases per 100 000 live births (an increase of 87%). At the same time, national rates of syphilis increased among women of reproductive age. OBJECTIVE To update the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2009 recommendation on screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF commissioned a reaffirmation evidence update to identify new and substantial evidence sufficient enough to change its prior recommendation. Given the established benefits and practice of screening for syphilis in pregnant women, the USPSTF targeted its evidence review on the direct benefits of screening on the prevention of congenital syphilis morbidity and mortality and the harms of screening for and treatment of syphilis infection in pregnant women. FINDINGS Using a reaffirmation process, the USPSTF found that accurate screening algorithms are available to identify syphilis infection. Effective treatment with antibiotics can prevent congenital syphilis and significantly decrease adverse pregnancy outcomes, with small associated harms, providing an overall substantial health benefit. Therefore, the USPSTF reaffirms its previous conclusion that there is convincing evidence that screening for syphilis infection in pregnant women provides substantial benefit. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF recommends early screening for syphilis infection in all pregnant women.

It is well established that perinatal depression can result in adverse short- and long-term effects on both the woman and child. OBJECTIVE To issue a new US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on interventions to prevent perinatal depression. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of preventive interventions for perinatal depression in pregnant or postpartum women or their children. The USPSTF reviewed contextual information on the accuracy of tools used to identify women at increased risk of perinatal depression and the most effective timing for preventive interventions. Interventions reviewed included counseling, health system interventions, physical activity, education, supportive interventions, and other behavioral interventions, such as infant sleep training and expressive writing. Pharmacological approaches included the use of nortriptyline, sertraline, and omega-3 fatty acids. FINDINGS The USPSTF found convincing evidence that counseling interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy, are effective in preventing perinatal depression. Women with a history of depression, current depressive symptoms, or certain socioeconomic risk factors (eg, low income or young or single parenthood) would benefit from counseling interventions and could be considered at increased risk. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the potential harms of counseling interventions as no greater than small, based on the nature of the intervention and the low likelihood of serious harms. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess the benefits and harms of other noncounseling interventions. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that providing or referring pregnant or postpartum women at increased risk to counseling interventions has a moderate net benefit in preventing perinatal depression. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF recommends that clinicians provide or refer pregnant and postpartum persons who are at increased risk of perinatal depression to counseling interventions.

Efficacious medication-based treatments are available and widely used, often alongside complementary psychosocial approaches. However, their effectiveness has been questioned because they might not address the broader clinical needs of many individuals with ADHD, especially over the longer term. Non-pharmacological approaches to treatment have proven less effective than previously thought, whereas scientific and clinical studies are starting to fundamentally challenge current conceptions of the causes of ADHD in ways that might have the potential to alter clinical approaches in the future. In view of this, we first provide an account of the diagnosis, epidemiology, and treatment of ADHD from the perspective of both the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the eleventh edition of the International Classification of Diseases. Second, we review the progress in our understanding of the causes and pathophysiology of ADHD on the basis of science over the past decade or so. Finally, using these discoveries, we explore some of the key challenges to both the current models and the treatment of ADHD, and the ways in which these findings can promote new perspectives.","[Posner, Jonathan] Columbia Univ, Vagelos Coll Phys & Surg, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Posner, Jonathan] Columbia Univ, New York State Psychiat Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Polanczyk, Guilherme V.] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Med, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Sonuga-Barke, Edmund] Kings Coll London, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat, London, England",,"Posner, J (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Vagelos Coll Phys & Surg, New York, NY 10032 USA.;Posner, J (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, New York State Psychiat Inst, New York, NY 10032 USA.",jonathan.posner@nyspi.columbia.edu,"Polanczyk, Guilherme V./AAF-6142-2021; Sonuga-Barke, Edmund j/D-9137-2011","Polanczyk, Guilherme V./0000-0003-2311-3289; ","NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH101172, R01 MH121070] Funding Source: Medline",NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)),,,135,131,138,32,140,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,FEB 8,2020,395,10222,,,,,450,462,,10.1016/S0140-6736(19)33004-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(19)33004-1,,,13,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),General & Internal Medicine,KK8PE,31982036,Green Accepted,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000512997500037,View Full Record in Web of Science,98498,0,8,77,55,30,124,99,67,120,83,21,120,69,31,37,2

Infected children and adults present with a range of medical and surgical conditions, and clinicians should consider the possibility of infection in individuals living in, or returning from, endemic regions. Although safe and effective drugs are donated free to endemic countries, only half of at-risk children received treatment in 2016. This Seminar describes the epidemiology, lifecycles, pathophysiology, clinical diagnosis, management, and public health control of soil-transmitted helminths. Previous work has questioned the effect of population-level deworming; however, it remains beyond doubt that treatment reduces the severe consequences of soil-transmitted helminthiasis. We highlight the need for refined diagnostic tools and effective control options to scale up public health interventions and improve clinical detection and management of these infections.","[Jourdan, Peter Mark; Fenwick, Alan] Imperial Coll London, Schistosomiasis Control Initiat, St Marys Campus, London, England; [Lamberton, Poppy H.

Even though there are global policies and guidelines for implementing stroke care, there are many challenges in setting up stroke services in LMICs. Despite these challenges, there are many models of stroke care available in LMICs-eg, multidisciplinary team care led by a stroke neurologist, specialist-led care by neurologists, physician-led care, hub and spoke models incorporating stroke telemedicine (ie, telestroke), and task sharing involving community health workers. Alternative strategies have been developed, such as reorganising the existing hospital infrastructure by training health professionals to implement protocol-driven care. The future challenge is to identify what elements of organised stroke care can be implemented to make the largest gain. Simple interventions such as swallowing assessments, bowel and bladder care, mobility assessments, and consistent secondary prevention can prove to be key elements to improving post-discharge morbidity and mortality in LMICs.","[Pandian, Jeyaraj D.; Sebastian, Ivy Anne] Christian Med Coll & Hosp, Dept Neurol, Ludhiana 141008, Punjab, India; [Kalkonde, Yogeshwar] SEARCH, Gadchiroli, India; [Felix, Cynthia] Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Urimubenshi, Gerard] Univ Rwanda, Coll Med & Hlth Sci, Kigali, Rwanda; [Urimubenshi, Gerard] Univ Glasgow, Inst Cardiovasc & Med Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Bosch, Jackie] McMaster Univ, Sch Rehabil Sci, Hamilton, ON, Canada",,"Pandian, JD (corresponding author), Christian Med Coll & Hosp, Dept Neurol, Ludhiana 141008, Punjab, India.",jeyarajpandian@hotmail.com,"Bosch, Jackie/AAP-6910-2021; Urimubenshi, Gerard/AAU-6599-2020; Bosch, Jackie/N-2816-2013","Urimubenshi, Gerard/0000-0002-0319-2912; Kalkonde, Yogeshwar/0000-0003-3543-3618; Bosch, Jackie/0000-0001-6292-4207",,,,,81,24,24,1,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,OCT 31,2020,396,10260,,,,,1443,1451,,,,,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,OI1EY,33129395,,,,2022-07-11,WOS:000583031700033,View Full Record in Web of Science,98900,0,50,80,24,38,27,28,7,52,64,40,12,33,27,48,26

Although invasive melanoma accounts for only 2% of all skin cancer cases, it is responsible for 80% of skin cancer deaths. Basal and squamous cell carcinoma, the 2 predominant types of nonmelanoma skin cancer, represent the vast majority of skin cancer cases. OBJECTIVE To update the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on behavioral counseling for the primary prevention of skin cancer and the 2009 recommendation on screening for skin cancer with skin self-examination. EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on whether counseling patients about sun protection reduces intermediate outcomes (eg, sunburn or precursor skin lesions) or skin cancer; the link between counseling and behavior change, the link between behavior change and skin cancer incidence, and the harms of counseling or changes in sun protection behavior; and the link between counseling patients to perform skin self-examination and skin cancer outcomes, as well as the harms of skin self-examination. FINDINGS The USPSTF determined that behavioral counseling interventions are of moderate benefit in increasing sun protection behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults with fair skin types. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that behavioral counseling interventions result in a small increase in sun protection behaviors in adults older than 24 years with fair skin types. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits and harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cancer. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF recommends counseling young adults, adolescents, children, and parents of young children about minimizing exposure to UV radiation for persons aged 6 months to 24 years with fair skin types to reduce their risk of skin cancer. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer counseling to adults older than 24 years with fair skin types about minimizing their exposure to UV radiation to reduce risk of skin cancer. Existing evidence indicates that the net benefit of counseling all adults older than 24 years is small. In determining whether this service is appropriate in individual cases, patients and clinicians should consider the presence of risk factors for skin cancer. (C recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cancer.

Most patients present with an antecedent illness, most commonly upper respiratory tract infection, before the onset of progressive motor weakness. Several microorganisms have been associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome, most notably Campylobacter jejuni, Zika virus, and in 2020, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In C jejuni-related Guillain-Barre syndrome, there is good evidence to support an autoantibody-mediated immune process that is triggered by molecular mimicry between structural components of peripheral nerves and the microorganism. Making a diagnosis of so-called classical Guillain-Barre syndrome is straightforward; however, the existing diagnostic criteria have limitations and can result in some variants of the syndrome being missed. Most patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome do well with immunotherapy, but a substantial proportion are left with disability, and death can occur. Results from the International Guillain-Barre Syndrome Outcome Study suggest that geographical variations exist in Guillain-Barre syndrome, including insufficient access to immunotherapy in low-income countries. There is a need to provide improved access to treatment for all patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome, and to develop effective disease-modifying therapies that can limit the extent of nerve injury. Clinical trials are currently underway to investigate some of the potential therapeutic candidates, including complement inhibitors, which, together with emerging data from large international collaborative studies on the syndrome, will contribute substantially to understanding the many facets of this disease.","[Shahrizaila, Nortina] Univ Malaya, Fac Med, Dept Med, Neurol Unit, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Lehmann, Helmar C.] Univ Cologne, Fac Med, Dept Neurol, Cologne, Germany; [Lehmann, Helmar C.] Univ Cologne, Univ Hosp Cologne, Cologne, Germany; [Kuwabara, Satoshi] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Chiba, Japan",,"Shahrizaila, N (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Med, Dept Med, Neurol Unit, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",nortina@um.edu.my,"Lehmann, Helmar C/G-4998-2016; SHAHRIZAILA, NORTINA/B-9402-2010","Lehmann, Helmar C/0000-0001-6205-2293; SHAHRIZAILA, NORTINA/0000-0003-0031-7692",,,,,152,59,59,15,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0140-6736,1474-547X,,LANCET,Lancet,MAR 27,2021,397,10280,,,,,1214,1228,,10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00517-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00517-1,,MAR 2021,15,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,RC7YE,33647239,,Y,N,2022-07-11,WOS:000633010800023,View Full Record in Web of Science,99270,0,69,128,72,84,81,108,51,103,147,87,142,31,37,33,3

We aimed to establish whether intravenous alteplase is safe and effective in such patients when salvageable tissue has been identified with imaging biomarkers. Methods We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data for trials published before Sept 21, 2020. Randomised trials of intravenous alteplase versus standard of care or placebo in adults with stroke with unknown time of onset with perfusion-diffusion MRI, perfusion CT, or MRI with diffusion weighted imaging-fluid attenuated inversion recovery (DWI-FLAIR) mismatch were eligible. The primary outcome was favourable functional outcome (score of 0-1 on the modified Rankin Scale [mRS]) at 90 days indicating no disability using an unconditional mixed-effect logistic-regression model fitted to estimate the treatment effect. Secondary outcomes were mRS shift towards a better functional outcome and independent outcome (mRS 0-2) at 90 days. Safety outcomes included death, severe disability or death (mRS score 4-6), and symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020166903. Findings Of 249 identified abstracts, four trials met our eligibility criteria for inclusion: WAKE-UP, EXTEND, THAWS, and ECASS-4. The four trials provided individual patient data for 843 individuals, of whom 429 (51%) were assigned to alteplase and 414 (49%) to placebo or standard care. A favourable outcome occurred in 199 (47%) of 420 patients with alteplase and in 160 (39%) of 409 patients among controls (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.49 [95% CI 1.10-2.03]; p=0.011), with low heterogeneity across studies (I-2=27%). Alteplase was associated with a significant shift towards better functional outcome (adjusted common OR 1.38 [95% CI 1.05-1.80]; p=0.019), and a higher odds of independent outcome (adjusted OR 1.50 [1.06-2.12]; p=0.022). In the alteplase group, 90 (21%) patients were severely disabled or died (mRS score 4-6), compared with 102 (25%) patients in the control group (adjusted OR 0.76 [0.52-1.11]; p=0.15). 27 (6%) patients died in the alteplase group and 14 (3%) patients died among controls (adjusted OR 2.06 [1.03-4.09]; p=0.040). The prevalence of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage was higher in the alteplase group than among controls (11 [3%] vs two [<1%], adjusted OR 5.58 [1.22-25.50]; p=0.024). Interpretation In patients who have had a stroke with unknown time of onset with a DWI-FLAIR or perfusion mismatch, intravenous alteplase resulted in better functional outcome at 90 days than placebo or standard care. A net benefit was observed for all functional outcomes despite an increased risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage. Although there were more deaths with alteplase than placebo, there were fewer cases of severe disability or death. Copyright (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of SMART in patients with persistent asthma. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION The databases of MEDLINE via OVID, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched from database inception through August 2016 and updated through November 28, 2017. Two reviewers selected randomized clinical trials or observational studies evaluating SMART vs inhaled corticosteroids with or without a LABA used as the controller therapy and short-acting beta-agonists as the relief therapy for patients aged 5 years or older with persistent asthma and reporting on an outcome of interest. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model to calculate risk ratios (RRs), risk differences (RDs), and mean differences with corresponding 95% CIs. Citation screening, data abstraction, risk assessment, and strength of evidence grading were completed by 2 independent reviewers. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Asthma exacerbations. RESULTS The analyses included 16 randomized clinical trials (N = 22 748 patients), 15 of which evaluated SMART as a combination therapy with budesonide and formoterol in a dry-powder inhaler. Among patients aged 12 years or older (n = 22 524; mean age, 42 years; 14 634 [65%] were female), SMART was associated with a reduced risk of asthma exacerbations compared with the same dose of inhaled corticosteroids and LABA as the controller therapy (RR, 0.68 [95% Cl, 0.58 to 0.80]; RD,-6.4% [95% Cl,-10.2% to-2.6%]) and a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids and LABA as the controller therapy (RR, 0.77 [95% Cl, 0.60 to 0.98]; RD, -2.8% [95% Cl,-5.2% to-0.3%]). Similar results were seen when SMART was compared with inhaled corticosteroids alone as the controller therapy. Among patients aged 4 to 11 years (n = 341; median age, 8 [range, 4-11] years; 69 [31%] were female), SMART was associated with a reduced risk of asthma exacerbations compared with a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids as the controller therapy (RR, 0.55 [95% Cl, 0.32 to 0.94]; RD,-12.0% [95% Cl,-22.5% to-1.5%]) or the same dose of inhaled corticosteroids and LABA as the controller therapy (RR, 0.38 [95% Cl, 0.23 to 0.63]; RD,-23.2% [95% Cl,-33.6% to-12.1%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this meta-analysis of patients with persistent asthma, the use of single maintenance and reliever therapy compared with inhaled corticosteroids as the controller therapy (with or without a long-acting P-agonist) and short-acting P-agonists as the relief therapy was associated with a lower risk of asthma exacerbations. Evidence for patients aged 4 to 11 years was limited.","[Sobieraj, Diana M.; Weeda, Erin R.; Nguyen, Elaine; Coleman, Craig I.; White, Michael; Baker, William L.] Univ Connecticut, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharm Practice, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Lazarus, Stephen C.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Div Pulm & Crit Care Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Blake, Kathryn V.] Nemours Childrens Specialty Care, Ctr Pharmacogen & Translat Res, Jacksonville, FL USA; [Lang, Jason E.] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Duke Childrens Hosp & Hlth Ctr, Div Allergy Immunol & Pulm Med, Durham, NC USA",,"Baker, WL (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Sch Pharm, 69 N Eagleville Rd,Unit 3092, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",william.baker_Jr@uconn.edu,"Nguyen, Elaine/ABG-6132-2021","Nguyen, Elaine/0000-0001-6695-3187; Coleman, Craig/0000-0003-4868-7158; Weeda, Erin/0000-0001-7876-5802; Sobieraj, Diana/0000-0002-5227-0681; Baker, William/0000-0003-2172-0931","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, US Department of Health and Human Services [HHSA290201500012I]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, US Department of Health and Human Services(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality)","This review was funded under contract No. HHSA290201500012I from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, US Department of Health and Human Services.",,48,151,154,1,27,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0098-7484,1538-3598,,JAMA-J AM MED ASSOC,JAMA-J.

In this section of the Series, we describe the emergence of NPS and consider opportunities for strengthening the detection, identification, and responses to future substances of concern. First, we explore the definitional complexity of the term NPS. Second, we describe the origins and drivers surrounding NPS, including motivations for use. Third, we summarise evidence on NPS availability, use, and associated harms. Finally, we use NPS as a case example to explore challenges and opportunities for future drug monitoring, surveillance, control, and public health responses. We posit that the current means of responding to emerging substances might no longer be fit for purpose in a world in which different substances can be rapidly introduced, and where people who use drugs can change preferences on the basis of market availability.","[Peacock, Amy; Bruno, Raimondo; Gisev, Natasa; Degenhardt, Louisa; Farrell, Michael] Univ New South Wales Sydney, Natl Drug & Alcohol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Peacock, Amy; Bruno, Raimondo] Univ Tasmania, Sch Psychol, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Hall, Wayne] Univ Queensland, Ctr Youth Subst Abuse Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Thomas, Kevin V.] Univ Queensland, Queensland Alliance Environm Hlth Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Hall, Wayne] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, Addict Dept, London, England; [Sedefov, Roumen; Griffiths, Paul] European Monitoring Ctr Drugs & Drug Addict, Lisbon, Portugal; [White, Jason] Univ South Australia, Sch Pharm & Med Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia",,"Peacock, A (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales Sydney, Natl Drug & Alcohol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",amy.peacock@unsw.edu.au,"Thomas, Kevin/AAO-2170-2020; White, Jason M/A-2795-2011; Hall, Wayne D/A-3283-2008; Peacock, Amy/L-8523-2013","Thomas, Kevin/0000-0002-2155-100X; White, Jason M/0000-0001-6750-1078; Hall, Wayne D/0000-0003-1984-0096; Peacock, Amy/0000-0002-5705-2026","Australian National Health and Medical Research Council [1109366, 1041472/1135991]; University of New South Wales Sydney; National Institute of Health [NIDA R01DA1104470]; Australian National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales Sydney; Australian Government Department of Health; European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE [R01DA044170] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Australian National Health and Medical Research Council(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); University of New South Wales Sydney; National Institute of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Australian National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales Sydney; Australian Government Department of Health(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Health & Ageing); European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission)","We thank the following people from the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales Sydney (Sydney, NSW, Australia) for their contribution to the systematic review components of this manuscript: Georgia Kelly, Harriet Townsend, and Lucy Tran.
