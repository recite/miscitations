# Motivated Citations

## Research Design

1. What?
	- Fancy Journals
		+ PNAS
		+ APSR
		+ Health ...

	- Pop psych/Serious science books

2. How?
	+ 10 articles from the last 4 volumes
		- 10 citations at random per article
		- 100 papers

### Why do people do it?

* motivated reasoning
* lazy
* manipulative
* cannot tell the quality

### Coding

* How central is the citation to the claims in the paper?

* Quality of evidence ...
	* Empirical results vs. not [vs. anecdata vs. think pieces]
	* Quality of empirical results
		* external validity
		* internal validity
		* replicability
		* size of the sample

* Qualifiers/limitations when people cite
	* correlation as causation
	* over-generalization: won't tell you about the context
	* make stronger claim than tenable 
		- strength of inference/statistical conclusion validity

### Minimum Sufficient Citation

* Minimum details: [n, context, research design]

* Counterfactual
	* Lay reader read this sentence what would they learn vs. when they read the paper
	* Responsibility of citee
		- Loss of information when we summarize is understandable but 
			- paper: key result + no contradicting result 
				- buy experimental design
				- n seems reasonable
