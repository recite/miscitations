Citations to what? Quality of evidence ...
	- Empirical results vs. not [vs. anecdata vs. think pieces]
	- Quality of empirical results
		* external validity
		* internal validity
		* replicability
		* size of the sample

- Qualifiers/limitations when people cite
	* don't frame cor. as cause
	* won't tell you about the context
		- broader claim: (over-generalization)
	* stronger claim -> strength of inference/statistical conclusion validity
		* minimum sufficient citation: [n, context, research design]
	* measurement validity

* Counterfactual
	- Lay reader read this sentence what would they learn vs. when they read the paper
	- Responsibility of citee
		- Loss of information when we summarize
			- paper: key result + no contradicting result 
				- buy experimental design
				- n seems reasonable
